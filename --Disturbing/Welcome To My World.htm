<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif">On June 14, 
2012 I sent an email from inside prison via contraband phone to several people 
who <span style="color: #2A2A2A">showed concern by making phone calls to the 
authorities about the deadly and inhumane imprisonment conditions where I was 
serving time for “Escape”.&nbsp; My lawyer, </span>Marcia Shein from Decatur<span style="color: #2A2A2A">, 
called warden Stanley Williams when the legal mail she sent was not being 
delivered to me. Paper mail is regulated in prison, even legal mail can get 
lost.&nbsp; E-mail is not regulated - so e-mail enables a power that was intended to 
be forbidden by the prison administration. By using this forbidden power, I 
contacted individuals which ultimately manifested my release from prison on 
October 5, 2012. <br>

is being presented to the United Nations Office of Human Rights that upholds the 
“Universal Declaration of Human Rights” which has also been violated.&nbsp; The 
matter should be brought to international courts if federal authorities will not 
condemn the illegal actions of state authorities.&nbsp; It is appropriate for the UN 
to take jurisdiction according to the founding charter of the United Nations.</span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: Tahoma,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A">

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A">The email I sent 
from prison on June 14 rightly accused the State of Georgia of trying to kill 
me. That e-mail caused the Georgia Department of Corrections to send an Internal 
Affairs investigator to meet with me the following day. Prison administration, 
angry for the stir I caused with forbidden internet access, punished me with 
various acts including a month in isolation (the hole), 5 property shakedowns 
and strip searches in a 5 week period, and being locked in a 1 man shower stall 
multiple times once for 5 hours. During the time I was in the hole the violence 
in the dorm I came out of escalated with over 10 new stabbings in just a few 
weeks. On July 19, 2012 one prisoner died in that dorm.&nbsp; At the time I sent the 
e-mail there had been 18 people stabbed in that 100 man dorm during the 9 months 
I had been there.&nbsp; About 30% of the prisoners in that dorm were stabbed in a 10 
month period.&nbsp; National Geographic recently called Smith State the worst prison 
in Georgia and one of the worst in the US.&nbsp; The Georgia Dept. of Corrections put 
me in the most violent dorm in that prison.&nbsp; My assessment of the danger being 
life threatening is accurate based on the facts. Georgia authorities use 
indirect capital punishment by creating the form of imprisonment and 
classification that they do.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
This was actually more of an escape from Smith State Prison (Level 5 
Disciplinary Camp) than a release due to people calling the prison and other 
authorities after learning of my situation via my contraband internet access.&nbsp; I 
was unexpectedly released on parole to no address. I am as free as a homeless 
man on house arrest.&nbsp; The federal court in the Northern District of Georgia 
recently ruled that my indigent financial state allows me to proceed in court 
without paying fees, therefore parole fees will also be an unreasonable demand.
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A">In 2008 the 9th 
circuit in the Northern District of California ruled in my case when I violated 
federal probation for not reporting or paying fees: The Honorable judge Martin 
Jenkins ruled that I was Not Guilty because &quot;the United States does not have a 
debtor’s prison&quot;. He then ordered the US Marshalls to reimburse my meals, hotel, 
and travel costs while I attended the probation revocation hearing in San 
Francisco. The Honorable Judge Martin Jenkins made that constitutional ruling 
that set me free while the US Attorney petitioned for prison time. Judge Jenkins 
has since moved from the 9th circuit to the U.S. Court of appeals. I am free 
from fines fees and obligation. Unjust probation justifies escape. Bartow County 
owes me lunch.&nbsp; The State of Georgia owes me freedom.&nbsp; They are in debt with me.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I was on unjust misdemeanor probation in Bartow County.&nbsp; The details of that 
“Reckless Conduct” charge in 2009 that turned into probation for climbing to the 
top of a water tower is documented in part 13 of my 2009 journal that contains 
photos of the climb and the documents of the double booking and double bonding 
episode that kept me initially imprisoned for 21 days for climbing the ladder.&nbsp; 
I had already been illegally over punished.&nbsp; I never reported to probation, and 
was arrested one year later for no reason other than that.&nbsp; The &quot;Bartow Blotter&quot; 
recorded that arrest on October 15, 2010 stating [* Brian Troy Aberle, 38, of 
1101 N. Tennessee St., Cartersville, was arrested by Cartersville police and 
charged with probation violation.] The sheriff’s son, David Millsap, was a 
frequent guest at that address where I was conducting my personal investigation 
into the truth.&nbsp; I was sentenced by the probation officer to my choice of 9 
weeks in jail or to pay a $2500 fine in addition to all that they had cost me 
already. I also knew about corruption in the Sheriffs Department. I chose to 
escape. <br>

<br>
This was my first escape. </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A"><br>
The arrest required coordination between US Marshalls, Cobb County Sheriffs, 
Bartow County Sheriffs and City of Smyrna police all of which were present for 
the arrest. The warrant did not grant authority to take my property. However, 
Bartow County deputy Gavon Wilkins took my laptop during the arrest. Why did 
they want the laptop so bad that they broke the law to take it?&nbsp; He was outside 
his jurisdiction and without a warrant to seize property. The sheriffs should be 
held to law and prosecuted for Theft by Taking, of my personal property. Bartow 
County demands money from me while they are in debt with me and therefore 
deserve even greater condemnation. They charged me with Theft by Taking for the 
clothes I took during my escape therefore they will be judged for what they did 
actually steal. </span>

The theft was the least of the crimes that I experienced in Bartow County. I

endured under the Bartow County Sheriffs.&nbsp; </span>

the Northern District of Georgia has taken over a year and still not made a

considering the serious and extreme violations documented in this lawsuit. The 
content of this lawsuit quickly came under FBI investigation. FBI agent Stanley 
Slater came to interview me at Smith State Prison on February 01, 2012 regarding

Back in 2007, the federal court in the Northern District of California had put 
me on probation because the over-zealous US Attorney was able to write a 
confession regarding my 1999 tax return inaccurately and threaten my wife and 
co-defendant with state custody of my children to leverage my wife of 13 years 
and mother of my 7 children to sign the confession as they worded it. She was 
told she would serve prison time if she did not sign it. My confession was 
written by the same US Attorney and came with the promise of release from 
incarceration if I agreed to his version of the confession.&nbsp; At my first hearing 
to enter the plea, after the judge had finished reading the confession he asked 
if the confession was correct, and I answered &quot;That’s not exactly how I would 
explain it&quot;. The honorable judge terminated the hearing because of my answer but 
rescheduled the hearing for the following day when I was instructed that I must 
say &quot;yes&quot; to be released.&nbsp; </span>

innocent of &quot;Tax Evasion&quot;.&nbsp; I pay tax that I owe and never misstated anything on 
my personal and corporate returns that were filed by a CPA.&nbsp; I explained the 
details in a chapter I wrote in a 2006 book titled &quot;If I die this is why they 
did it.&quot; That book about illegal tyrannical IRS policies also included a chapter 
about the failure of the war on drugs, a topic that led me to Bartow County.&nbsp; I 
am also actually Not Guilty of Escape, because the incarceration was not 
constitutionally lawful therefore the escape was. To be certain the sheriff 
knows I am unapologetic, I escaped a second time. The second escape took place 
out of the &quot;Maximum Security&quot; dorm where I climbed the recreation yard wall to 
the roof above visitor parking, beyond all the fences.<br>

Sheriff Clark Millsap knows me as a journalist or investigator researching about 
the whole story behind the convictions of a senior GBI agent who maintained a 
desk at the Bartow County Sheriffs department, and a former captain and head of 
the Drug Task Force for Bartow Sheriffs Department. They were convicted for 
pocketing cash and reselling guns illegally confiscated from drug dealers. I had 
emailed Sheriff Clark Millsap long before the escapes regarding my work. <br>

<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A">Nobody was ever 
prosecuted for all the drugs stolen from the Sheriffs evidence locker and from 
drug dealers. Those drugs were sold back onto the street in Chattanooga. When 
the drugs were stolen from the evidence locker it caused the district attorney 
to become aware that evidence required for trial was not available. The District 
Attorney chose to focus his energy on getting a plea confession signed at any 
cost. The cases that demanded a jury trial were eventually dismissed for statute 
of limitations expiration. The DA, Sheriff, and Judge help to conceal the true 
extent of the crimes that actually took place in their county. All the 
convictions by plea are void due to the unscrupulous motivation to deny a trial 
that is a constitutional right.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A">The failure of 
justice is in plain sight for all who are willing to look at it. I escaped two 
times from a sheriff that had drugs stolen from his evidence locker. The sheriff 
and judge together chose to cover up the theft and punish the escape. The FBI 
also chose to under-punish the sheriff’s captain who was only charged for 
pocketing cash and reselling guns that were illegally confiscated from drug 
dealers. The actual amounts were no less than $800,000 but only a small fraction 
of that was on the indictment. The juries agreed that my case was over charged 
and found me Not Guilty of the additional indictment charges that were also 
&quot;Terroristic Threats&quot; that I allegedly made to Sheriff Clark Millsap, 
&quot;Dissemination of Terroristic Threats&quot;, &quot;Interference with Government Property&quot; 
and &quot;Theft by Taking&quot;.&nbsp; All I did was &quot;Escape&quot;, I never threatened him with 
anything but truth. Those who by mercy had been undercharged were overcharging 
me so they deserve the greater condemnation.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<span style="font-family: Arial,sans-serif; color: #2A2A2A">The justice system 
is perverted.&nbsp; When the sheriffs son, David Millsap, was first caught with drugs 
and a gun he was not booked at the jail until 19 hours later after deciding that 
it could not be ignored due to the witnesses.&nbsp; This gave him time to go home, 
call dad, and get his bond money ready so that he could bond out before ever 
being held in custody at the jail.&nbsp; It would be nice if average people got such 
good treatment from the sheriff when they get arrested with dope and guns.&nbsp; 
David Millsap’s indictment didn’t come until 4 years later.&nbsp; My over charged 
indictment came immediately; his was almost lost for good.&nbsp; The District 
Attorney says that there is no foul play in the justice system but those with 
eyes to see must willfully believe that lie or reject that lie. </span>

Clark Millsap.&nbsp; She has exhausted my finance resources and Bartow County has 
already paid for two jury trials.&nbsp; I deserve another jury trial since I had no 
lawyer and represented myself Pro Se at both trials when the violations of my 
rights denied me a fair trial.&nbsp; I need a Change of Venue which judge Carey 
Nelson already denied.&nbsp; The judge was aware of the barbaric conditions of my 
imprisonment and my research and he allowed the trial to take place. He is Party
