---------------------------------------------------------------
Nov 26 - new build
---------------------------------------------------------------
Nov 26 - several small additions to GString
Nov 26 - 1 new feature addition - the ability to map 2 different object types into the same data structure.

May 9  - Added GString32 and GString0 into the Android build
May 9  - Updated the root article, and the disturbing folder
May 9  - return void inplace of an unused return value constant 1 in GProfile - the return was 'reserved' for support that was never needed.
May 9  - Updated the datatypes in the GProfile - it was built before the 'bool' datatype was supported in all C++ compilers
Apr 30 - removed SpookeyHash.h/.cpp files from the distribution - they serve no purpose.
Apr 29 - Ported the recent library changes to Linux64 - source sync to most recent Xfer build

Apr 25 - added GString::Unicode() regardless of the _UNICODE preprocessor - and fixed it to copy the terminating null
Apr 18 - Set all examples to use GProfile format of INI not XML
Apr 17 - Completed port to x86 WinCE  (it was ported to ARMv4 WinCE in 2007)
Apr 17 - Added GString0 and GString32 into the Linux makefile and fixed up the UNICODE support in those files
Apr5-6 - Ran the Microsoft Code Analysis in MSDev2012, reviewed all output silenced some warnings, added a few if(!Null) checks
Apr5-6 - Added two new utility classes GString0, and GString32, modified XMLObject and GString for them
Apr5-6 - see note under [m_pzkTheWord] in [IndexObjects.cpp] about why the new GStrings were created.

Mar 22 - Renamed CMultiPartForm to GMultiPartForm, heavily commented GHTTPMultiPartPost.cpp Mar 21 - added a new example program CustomHTTPService that uses the new ServerCore hooks
Mar 21 - added GlobalKeyPartLists to XMLObject it removed a non-growing memory leak(it wasnt really a problem but looks ugly in memory diagnostic tools)
Mar 21 - added new axample program ContainOrInherit
Mar 21 - fixed ~XMLRelationshipWrapper().  It works just the same - but the code is better. Ran all regression tests
Mar 21 - added all the extern's at the bottom of AbstractionGeneric.h, once used only buy XMLObject they can be used anywhere.
Mar 20 - fixed a small memory leak in XMLObject, and added call to gthread_process_initialize() from global 'dtor

Mar 18 - Added documentation updates to code everywhere I touched, the newer comments in GString.h are helpful and humorous
Mar 18 - Fixed a bug in the GBTreeIterator, I had two pop()'s where i needed top()'s - its fixed now.
Mar 7 - GHash Lookup() speed is essentially equal to GSparshHash now - Notes in ExIndexObjects
Mar 7 - removed SpookyHash - Timed Rotating Hash vs FVN (FVN is over 2x faster.) Raised initial hash table size in ExIndexObjects
Mar 6 - added new example program "TheOIDProtocol" for the IETF discussion
Feb 19 - commented the need for (/EHa) in ExceptionHandlerScope() in ExceptionHandler.h where the compiler warning is generated
Feb 19 - Made the Base class of GString public so the class can be thrown as a C++ exception

Feb 11 - Version 211 (released on February 11)
Jan      in a rare case using compression a bug was fixed in GZip by upgrading XMLFoundation to the current zlib source
Jan      changed the default value of nGrowByAllocationSize from 1024 to -1 in GString.h - a major performance fix for BigData
Jan      XML reserved byte escaping in GString::AppendEscapeXMLReserved() is now correct by the W3C XML1.0/1.1 spec + custom overrides.
Jan 11 - Version 111 (released on January 11)
