---------------------------------------------------------
possibly in a rare case with an app using compression a bug was fixed in GZip by upgrading XMLFoundation to the current zlib source
changed the default value of nGrowByAllocationSize from 1024 to -1 in GString.h - a major performance fix for BigData
XML reserved byte escaping in GString::AppendEscapeXMLReserved() is now correct by the W3C XML1.0/1.1 spec + custom overrides.
