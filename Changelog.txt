Dec 26 - checked all sprintf(), GString::Format() calls for "%d"'s that could be supplied an __int64 where an int32 is expected.
Dec 27 - wrote XMLObject::GetOIDKeyPartList() which causes only 1 Key Part list per type using OID's, no longer 1 per instance

Welcome to the  year   2014 ********* 2014 ********* 2014 ********* 2014 ******* 2014

January 3 2014   - Focus on fast - via less reliance on the memory manager in the operating system.

This version is about 3 times FASTER at generating the disk XML document from the memory XML docment.
It is also faster at assembling the XML memmory document.

Jan 3 - changes to XML_MUTEX macro, a performance improvement for Windows to use native CRITICAL_SECTIONS many in CacheManager
Jan 3 - Major updates to GList, namely NodeCaching, to block alloc nodes and reduce calls to new()/delete()
Jan 3 - xmlObject now uses MemberDescriptor block allocations - same reason - reduce calls to new()/delete()
Jan 3 - FactoryManager switched from GList to GArray
Jan 3 - Inlining for performance - MemberDescriptor, xmlLex, and more
Jan 3 - StackFrameCheck changed from the GList to a bare essential GStack - this one change alone DOUBLED the speed of ToXML()
Jan 3 - Changed the OIDKeyPartList to be static per type, rather than one per instance.  Note: All objects of the same type 
        have the same key definition - so this change eliminated many unnecessary identical GList instances.
Jan 3 - Changed many myGString->Format("%s%s","one","two");  into  myGString << "one" << "two"; as it is about 5 times faster.
Jan 3 - double checked alls printf/Format "%d"'s to be certain that 64 bit integers were not being put in them - (that can crash)
Jan 5 - removed the Node 'ctor() call - replace call to new() with a cast in GListNodeCache.h
Jan 5 - Tested IndexObjects on Centos 64, Windows 32 and 64
Jan 7 - Several minor changes were needed to complete the recent memory managed updates so that 
   	 - all the console example programs have been reverified, also verified the Android NDK build
Jan 8 - finished up verifying all the example programs, the MFCTypesFromXML was updated today.
Jan 8 - Added a base class to GString, a design change that will allow various GString sizeof() definitions.
Jan 9 - Updated/Tested the XMLDialog sample application - added a button to add Order LineItems
Jan 9 - removed the "5LoavesTray" example from the global project Workspace.  The example is for Windows95/98/ME.
Jan 9 - Corrected the VS2012 Solution paths to attach the debugger/Launch with F5/Ctrl F5 for all example programs.
Jan 9 - Ported to iOS, updated the iOS XCode project file, tested the iPhone Example - ObjectiveObjects
Jan 9 - Ported to Windows Phone, tested the example program.
Jan 9 - Tested every example under CentOS 64, and re-verified the Android ndk-build too.
Jan 9 - All Examples are tested and up to date - this is version 2014 Release 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jan 11 - Finalized this Build 111 - published the article update.
Jan 15 - changed FromFile/ToFile in GString to be virtual.
Jan 15 - added 3 new methods to XMLObject, an interface simplification with GString reuse. ToXMLFile/ToXML/FromXMLFile
Jan 16 - changed several int to bool where the value was always 1 or 0 in GString
Jan 23 - removed the unused GString::AppendXMLTabs()
Jan 24 - fixed GString::AppendEscapeXMLReserved() to stop unnecessarily escaping some special chars 
Jan 24 - updated ObjectCache regression test results accordingly
Jan 24 - added 2 new serialize flags NO_CONTROL_CHAR_ESCAPE	   NO_0_31_CHAR_ESCAPE
Jan 25 - added the new class GStringCipherZip in GStringCipherZip.h
Jan 28 - more work on AppendEscapeXMLReserved(), now applies attribute ascapse rules to only attributes - not elements
Feb 1 - major work on GZip.cpp importing the newest Zlib that includes a rare bug fix - Zlib authors recommend everyone update
Feb 1 - removed 3 unused "using" statements from the Java example program for Android that uses ServerCore.cpp (Xfer uses compression)
Feb 1 - added Cipher(), DeCipher(), Compress(), and DeCompress() to GString
Feb 2 - added more overloads of the above methods in GString
Feb 5 - changed the default value of nGrowByAllocationSize from 1024 to -1 in GString.h - a major performance fix for BigData
Feb 5 - made a small change to GPerformanceTimer so that it can be used from a GUI as well as a console shell
Feb 6 - added NO_OBJECT_DATA, and made various performance improvements
Feb 6 - added the beginning of a new example program called BigData
Feb 7 - Commented the VIRTUAL toXML in XMLObject.h, references two examples of a major previously undocumented feature
211 - The (unexpected) Fixes and changes since v111 are enough to warrant 2014's Version 211.  Along with more documentation.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feb 11 - Finalized Build 211 - published the article update.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
