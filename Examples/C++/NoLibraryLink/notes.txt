add all the files under XMlFoundation/src
EXCPEPT

WinCERuntimeC.cpp 
src/Utils/EnglishErrors.cpp 
WinINetHTTPDataSource.cpp (unless you arre on Windows and you plan to use it and link wininet also)
and do not add any source from /src/Win32PThreads1998

link to wsock32.lib (if you are on Windows)


On Windows: I turned off precompiled headers because VC++ will otherwise want #include "stdafx.h" in every source file from XMLFoundation source that you put into your project.
