<h2>Introduction  </h2>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Welcome to XMLFoundation - May 2014</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Software projects can fail for many reasons. In 
mission critical software projects there is a common objective to avoid 
design-resource dependencies. If one critical resource is run over by a bus, the 
whole project can become &quot;bus terminated&quot;. In a lesser &quot;mission critical&quot; 
context, when another company hires away your undervalued programmer - then 
management finds out that the new guy can&#39;t just pick up where the undervalued 
guy left off. Some smaller thinking programmers even convolute code, or leave 
out a few necessary comments just for job security. I am normally here to 
support anybody using XMLFoundation in some way that uncovers an error or 
missing feature - however many external events could &quot;bus terminate&quot; this &quot;live&quot; 
support. XMLFoundation is designed and organized to prevent failure and stand 
the test of time. There are no outstanding bugs. There are no feature requests 
awaiting implementation. There are no disputes to the claim that this is the 
worlds fastest XML Parser. XMLFoundation is being used more than ever before and 
at the same time the need for me to answer questions has decreased due to the 
heavily commentated and exemplified code. At this point, termination of myself 
will not be the termination of a project based on XMLFoundation. The next 
economic gut bubble that vents it self wont blow XMLFoundation away.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">I remember when XML 1.0 was disruptive. The <strong>
sudden</strong> appearance of a global standard <strong>immediately</strong> 
forced projects worldwide to change course, not all could. Projects that could 
not react to the disruptive technology (or the opportunity) are now built on 
less standard protocols that now excludes them from some new use case scenarios 
or forces them to add layers of inefficiency and failure points in retrospect 
design. It&#39;s no wonder why software projects are so well known for failure. Many 
things can go wrong, and times change fast. If you search the internet for the 
term &quot;Disruptive Technology&quot; along with &quot;Capitol&quot; or &quot;Venture&quot;, you will see 
that &quot;Disruptive Technology&quot; is sought after and valued even though it disrupts 
culture and/or other businesses. XMLFoundation is Disruptive Technology. It&#39;s 
like what vehicle radar detectors once were to police radar guns. Is that 
Disruptive Technology or Defensive Driving? Technology defends us from 
technology at every level. The performance numbers XMLFoundation produces does 
disrupt some technology business plans. In most technology plans, XMLFoundation 
merely adds new options.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">When referencing this &quot;Article&quot; at [xml-dev] I 
called it bloggish. I remember reading Stroustrups First edition of &quot;The C++ 
Programming Language&quot;, which had interesting quotes in it, here are a few 
re-quotes from the Fourth edition:</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"> </p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Don&#39;t interrupt me while I&#39;m 
interrupting.<br />
-Winston S. Churchill<br />
Premature optimization is the root of all evil.<br />
-Donald Knuth<br />
On the other hand, we cannot ignore efficiency.<br />
-Jon Bentley<br />
The purpose of computing is insight, not numbers.<br />
-R. W. Hamming<br />
... but for the student, numbers are often the best road to insight.<br />
-A. Ralston<br />
 </p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><hr /></p><p align="left" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">
In his book, Stroustrup injects some &quot;bloggish&quot; quotes like this:</p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">&quot;<strong>... there is nothing 
more difficult to carry out, nor more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to 
handle, than to initiate a new order of things. For the reformer makes enemies 
of all those who profit by the old order, and only lukewarm defenders in all 
those who would profit by the new order...&quot; </strong> </p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">-Niccol `o Machiavelli </p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">&nbsp;<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=D7EC275E76D295CF!1400">Other 
Machiavelli Quotes</a> that didn&#39;t fit in &quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot;</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">
<hr />So it is fitting and proper to add into the chronicles of technology 
insight.....</p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The more numerous the laws, the 
more corrupt the state <br />
-Tacitus</p><p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The corrupt state has 
enough laws that anyone can be arrested and charged with an arbitrary violation, <br />
ensuring that a State reformer will be a victim of the Court of Law, the Sword 
of the State. <br />
-Brian Aberle</p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The court can take the reformers 
children and give them to another man and your codefendant. <br />
-Dorn Thorn in the Corn Justice Porn with a Cop in his Pocket</p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">If the reformer continues to 
evade prison and death long enough that neither prison nor death can stop the 
vision of reform, then there will be a new order of things. <br />
-Brian Aberle  </p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"> </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">
Here in the chronicles of technology insight, you might read something rogue or 
startling as you wander just a few links deep. There is an entire directory in 
the source distribution called &quot;-Disturbing&quot; that disturbs me more than you. 
Just imagine, a disturbed person creating disruptive technology. It&#39;s like 
having PTSD and ADD. Meet the author of XMLFoundation. When I saw that 
Addison-Wesley allowed Mr. Stroustrup to publish &quot;Programming is like sex...&quot; in 
&quot;The C++ Programming Language&quot;, then I knew that it&#39;s OK to have a little bit of 
fun with this stuff as we teach. So check out the new section in this 
documentation - <a href="#The_Sexy_GString">The Sexy GString</a>.   </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">
There are some heavier areas of exemplification and documentation that still 
need to be done, specifically in the areas of Distributed Object Designs, and 
XML-DBMS integration and the Java integration, these areas and topics are as 
foundational in XMLFoundation as the <a href="#GProfile_-_The_App_Registry">
GProfile</a>, which just now got it&#39;s first real bit of documentation. If anyone 
would like to rent my hourly help, we will help each other contact me: XMLBoss 
at live dot com.</p>
<p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">
<br />
Programming is like sex: It may give some concrete results, but that is not why 
we do it.<br />

<h2><a name="What_is_the_XMLFoundation">What is the XMLFoundation</a></h2>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">XMLFoundation is a cross platform application 
foundation. GString and xmlLex are 1 and yet they can be separated. The G 
classes are &quot;designed&quot; for each other - not simply &quot;used&quot; together. The GString 
now supports Compress and Cipher as member methods. Since both GZip and TwoFish 
are very portable and since the GString is designed for binary data equally as 
much as for character string data - the combination is a natural fit that 
deserves to be in the base class of GString. This comes after synchronizing 
GZip.cpp in the XMLFoundation with the latest source code from <a href="http://zlib.net/">
http://zlib.net/</a>, an update that includes a fix for a rare compression bug. 
Zlib implements compression for most applications built after 1996. The authors 
recommend that all users of Zlib should upgrade and obtain the fix. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The XMLFoundation library contains many things. 
From utilities to frameworks, (plural to plural). The XMLFoundation implements a 
use of XML that it is about 3 times faster that the best that can be done with 
SAX, when parsing XML for the purpose of an update to some dataset that you 
already have. It is a very common task in the application layer or in a DBMS 
that uses XML as a native input protocol. In that case, if a key word OID is 
present as the first attribute we can be triple fast AND use 50% less memory. 
This is accomplished by eliminating a temporary memory copy made by typical XML 
parsers as well as eliminating many arguments being pushed and popped from the 
stack by using xmlLex::getToken(*tok) explained in more detail where performance 
is discussed.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The fact that the first 3 letters are ALL CAPS 
of in XMLFoundation understates the C++ FOUNDATIONAL application development 
tools ( which contain an XML Parser (like the C++ framework QT) ). Building on 
GString is like building on a &quot;better&quot; ostream. Opinion has no place amid 
&quot;better&quot; performance data. Every application that was ever built on ostream 
could benefit from the XMLFoundation. All the utilities are carefully designed 
to be a portable platform everywhere that a C++ compiler exists (like the 
popular C++ library Boost (which XMLFoundation compliments nicely) ). 
XMLFoundation&#39;s GThread is still the only pthread port for Windows Phone that I 
know of. Windows Phone is now the third-largest OS across Europe with 10 percent 
of the smart phone market -- more than double its share compared with last year. 
I support it. Behind the Capitol XML is a solid application Foundation.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">In the past 30 days, there have been several 
minor &quot;fixes&quot; in the XMLFoundation as well - so all of this deserved being put 
together into build 211 that is already serving several production applications. 
Additionally, new documentation now includes example use of the virtual ToXML() 
method of XMLObject in the new example program titled BigData. Since 
XMLFoundation is <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">the fastest 
XML Parser on earth</span>, it stands as the most viable solution for 
integration of massive XML data sets - most will be to/from an SQL database - 
but where BigData meets XML - the XMLFoundation is a solution present. Despite 
the focus on XMLFoundation support for the equally important mobile platforms 
(iOS/Android/Windows Phone), XMLFoundation originated from the high performance 
needs of large data warehousing and is positioned to be the de facto standard 
for BigData XML just as zlib became the de facto compression. Zlib is officially 
de facto according to wikipedia - which is often known to be incorrect in 
certain topics, but I believe it is correct in this case.</p>

<h2><a name="Calling_All_Chiefs">Calling All Chiefs for a Pow Wow</a></h2>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">This is what was happening on March 31, 2014</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Of recent, I have sought out &#39;leaders&#39; in the 
domain of XML to present a proposal for a futuristic XML that has 2 new small 
keywords that prefix an attribute list in a 100% syntactically backwards 
approach as to not not disrupt any XML 1.0/1.1 software. To assemble the chiefs 
for a pow wow on the subject requires the attendance from the leaders of many 
technical worlds. IETF is a moderated forum (like codeproject.com is moderated) 
and OASIS is unmoderated, once famous for hosting [xml-dev] where interfaces 
like SAX and DOM were created by unmoderated open debate and consensus.</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">I have been building and perfecting the examples 
in preparation for presenting this concept to the industry leaders. The concept 
is a &#39;new&#39; idea - or as someone pointed out it&#39;s a variation of a perma-thread 
from the old days. In this article I had mentioned something about &quot;Object 
Databases&quot; almost changing the world once but there was a performance problem - 
so the world is square.</p>
<p align="left" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The discussion got hot at [xml-dev] 
until OASIS experienced malfunctions that had the list servers down for a total 
of 4 and a half days. OASIS Tech support had no response to some people and a 
broken hyperlink for problem ticket 2546 for other people. The discussion lasted 
for 2 days and brought out excellent debate and advancement in the documentation 
of the concept. Many &quot;Authorities&quot; on XML commented prior to the server failure 
that stopped the discussion for almost 5 days. I am trying to communicate this 
architectural design concept to all who can understand. For those seeking to 
understand the design concepts, I believe it is best to read the questions asked 
by &quot;Experts&quot; on the subject of XML and read the 2 day discussion. While 
discussing &#39;new&#39; concepts like this, various views and terminology used in other 
people questions is helpful to read. The discussion at [xml-dev] mostly 
accomplished documenting the outline for an official &#39;Internet Draft&quot; based on a 
summary of this discussion that fortunately was archived outside of OASIS 
servers. </p><p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"> <strong>The 
[xml-dev] discussion archive:</strong><br />
<a style="color: rgb(0, 114, 198); text-decoration: none;" href="http://www.altova.com/list/xml-dev/201403/" target="_blank">
http://www.altova.com/list/xml-dev/201403/</a> <br />

</p><p align="center" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;"><strong>Please use the forum 
following this article to document any additional point to cover in a <br />
formal &quot;Internet Draft&quot; document for standards approval - In progress.</strong></p><p align="center">
 </p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Recently I added a &quot;major&quot; new example 
program. It&#39;s mostly been there all the time but it never had a makefile - see 
CustomHTTPService. It builds a static web server and implements a simple post 
handler AND a multi-part-form handler. It&#39;s great server platform based on 
ServerCore.cpp</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">Recently I also added a new example program 
called ContainOrInherit, explaining the difference between containment design 
and inheritance design, and the GProfile now supports XML format since that 
could be useful. See the (large) comment explaining the reasoning for adding XML 
support to GProfile 14 years after designing it amid all this XML support.</p><p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">
Earlier in March 2014, The bulk of the work was in the files Console.cpp and 
5LoavesSvc.cpp - both are excellent frameworks for any service. Those files are 
not tied tightly to ServerCore.cpp, they use ServerCore.cpp. Those files are a 
very useful starting point &#39;design patterns&#39; for many applications. They are 
intended to be generic for anyone needing to build a windows service. Those two 
files are not about XML, they are about Foundation.</p>

<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">This is what was new on Jan 11, 2014</p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">This is a point in the XMLFoundation project 
that I will switch my focus to the porting and development of several 
applications that were designed and built using older versions of the 
XMLFoundation library. Recently my focus had been enhancing the XMLFoundation. I 
have more than one application that still has yet to be ported to 64 bit. In the 
future, updates to this main article will indicate a major update versus the 
daily or frequent updates of the most recent source at the external link. The 
current XMLFoundation and the examples are very much a result of user feedback. 
Even the changelog.txt was started in response the suggestion that someone gave 
me. Good idea. The new
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=D7EC275E76D295CF!1032">
ChangeLogTail.txt</a> was my idea. If you come up with a new example program, 
idea (great or small), or feedback that might help others - don&#39;t keep it to 
yourself - share it with. Share it with myself and the public on the forum at 
the bottom of this page, or share/discuss it with me directly ( Roaring 
Checkmate At Live dot com). I ask for this feedback despite the fact that 
recently there has been more &quot;downvoting&quot; than ever before. The old &quot;5 Star&quot; 
XMLFoundation has new &quot;1 Star&quot; haters. </p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt;">The very old section in this document titled â€œ<a href="#Faster_than_Fast">Faster 
than Fast</a>â€, written in 2009, was put together to give some explanation and 
emphasis to the fact that XMLFoundation is fast.<span>  </span>The XMLFoundation 
is FASTER in 2014. (as much as <span style="background: yellow;">3 TIMES FASTER</span> 
at some operations than any 2013 release).<span>  </span>Thank God for numbers, 
because words can say anything, but numbers divides fact from words. This 2014 
speed-leap comes from customized memory management.<span>   </span>This is as 
simple as reducing calls to the generalized global memory manager in the 
operating system via calls to new() and delete(). The concept is simple, and 
there are various approaches.<span>  </span>The goal is to obtain heap memory 
for a set of operations that you might define as 1 transaction or complete task. </p><p>

I have the advantage of having done custom memory management before so I applied 
an experienced approach toward accomplishing this.<span>  </span>In this 
release, I abundantly commented the source code changes and additions to 
document exactly how this custom memory management is accomplished. <span>  </span>
The proof is in the numbers exactly how important of an issue memory management 
is â€“ regardless of your target being on an Android phone or a 64 bit Windows 
server â€“ the same concept applies to memory management. </p><p>

Additionally â€“ as we kick off 2014 with a massive reduction in the reliance of 
the operating systems memory manager â€“ we raised the roof for 32 bit 
processing limits that are reached when new() returns NULL.<span>  </span>So, if 
faster is not what you need â€“ perhaps you will enjoy the higher processing 
limits that you can now achieve in the same memory limitations that you have 
always had.<span> 
</span>FASTER execution and HIGHER limits are both achieved by the same upgrade 
in this release.<span>  </span>I expect that this raised the roof for 64 bit 
limits as well â€“ but I have never seen that roof.  </p><p>

The bulk of the memory management documentation is in the code, I will conclude 
the introduction to the 2014 version with the basic steps that make it all 
happen.</p><p>In XMLObject.h, the new method : </p><pre>virtual int GetMemberMapCount() </pre><p>
returns the number of MemberMaps() that all objects of any specific type will 
have mapped to them. Knowing this, XMLObject will preallocate a chunk of memory 
large enough to hold the details of ALL MemberDescriptor()&#39;s that contain that 
information at runtime for the object instance - in the primitave days of 2013 
each MemberDescriptor was allocated a global heapspace of it&#39;s own using new()</p><p>
The code in XMLObject.cpp now looks like this - to manage the memory blocks</p>
<pre lang="cs">int nArraySize = GetMemberMapCount(0);
m_pMemberDescriptorArray = malloc(sizeof(MemberDescriptor) * nArraySize); 
</pre>GList made did a similiar change. Here is a bit from GListNodeCache that 
aplies the same concept a bit differently. <pre>void *pBlock = malloc(sizeof(GList::Node) * NODES_PER_ALLOC); </pre><p> 
// Now we access individual nodes like this: The temp variable pVoid is for 
readability.... </p>
<pre lang="cs">void *pVoid = ((char *)pBlock) + ( sizeof(GList::Node)*nBlockIndex);
GList::Node *pNodeInBlock = (GList::Node *)pVoid; </pre><p> // this is the same 
code as above with no temp variable. It is a type cast with pointer arithmetic</p><pre lang="cs">pNodeInBlock = (GList::Node *)((void *)(((char *)pBlock)+(sizeof(GList::Node)*nBlockIndex))); </pre><h2> </h2>

<p>This is what was new December 21st 2013  </p><p>
MurmurHash was the latest big advancement in Hashing. It was published in Austin 
Applebyâ€™s personal blog. Google hired him and has taken over Murmurhash, and 
published a variant of it called CityHash. Strangely, many Google publications 
failed to recognize SpookyHash - published October 31, Ground Hog Day, and other 
celebrated days, citing only MurmurHash. 
</p><p>Here are two links to help you quickly catch up on hashing algorithms to 
get your prerequisites up to date. To cut through all the trending Hash Hype, I 
recommend this brief overview of hashing.:</p><p>

<a href="http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/06/why-computer-science-professors-dislike-hash-functions/">
http://www.homolog.us/blogs/blog/2013/05/06/why-<strong>computer-science-professors-dislike</strong>-hash-functions/</a>          </p>
<p>I wanted to see if CityHash could help me speed up my indexing scheme so I 
decided to test SpookyHash/CityHash within GHash which is part of XMLFoundation. 
The test counts CPU cycles and/or microseconds on both Windows and Linux while 
indexing large datasets for both 32 and 64 bit applications. The source code for 
this test is included in the example program ExIndexObjects. </p>
<p>The results are very interesting. GHash is so fast that CityHash slows it 
down. The GHash is a unique algorithm designed to index XMLObjects â€“ but it 
can index anything. In summary, GHash is an Array of B-Trees. It handles hash 
collisions so efficiently that it eliminates need for &quot;low collision&quot; hashing 
algorithms such as CityHash which use far more CPU than a simple Rotating Hash, 
and further research will determine just how low it can go in the simplification 
of that step. </p><p>
CRC-<em>n</em>. is faster than CityHash. For Checksumming, or creating a hash 
function with a perfect distribution (aka avalanche effect) CRC is a better 
choice. CityHash and SpookyHash are curious works in math that have only 1 
possible application â€“ they can destroy data quickly(like the Google Code). If 
you have a HUGE amount of sensitive data and want to delete it (which will mark 
the disk sectors â€˜freeâ€™ for the OS to use) and DESTROY it so that it could 
never be recovered by any disk utility tools. There are many free utilities that 
accomplish this already, but with these new algorithms the software can 
accomplish more block corruption in less time. Why does Google Inc invest in and 
market algorithms with no purpose in any of their active projects? If I was a 
share-holder I would vote for new management. </p><p>

<code>GHash</code> ought not be confused with a block cruncher. The name <code>
GHashTableTreeStack</code>
was too long so itâ€™s called <code>GHash</code>. The long name would be more 
proper, like Mr. Hash. GHash is one single &quot;Data Structure Algorithm&quot; that 
combines multiple algorithms and data structures (see highlighted) as parts of 
the whole. GHash uses a Rotating Hash to index a Static Array of Binary Trees. A 
GBTree is a variant of an automatically balancing AVL Tree that contains an 
alternate index so that beyond traverse Ascending and Descending (like any 
B-Tree via Left/Right) it also has a secondary index via Next/Previous which 
allows the <code>GBTree</code> to also be traversed in the order that items were 
inserted. The secondary index can optimize certain bulk commits (aka disk 
writes) of individual updates that were applied while it was stored in RAM by 
GBTree. The GHash cannot do that, but it uses a
<code>GBTree</code> that can. The XML data updates and application layer updates 
primarily use only the primary index. Upon a special kind of commit the 
fragmented memory structure can be flattened back to itâ€™s initial state into 
the same order that they came from the disk. Another important algorithmic 
component of GHash is the unique (aka one of a kind) <code>GHashIterator</code> 
which allows SIMPLE and non-blocking THREAD-SAFE iteration of this complex data 
structure via an internal integer index into the Static Array used in 
combination with a GBTreeIterator which is maintains two <code>GStack</code>s 
that act as LIFO queues of state information used to quickly iterate the Tree 
portion of this structure, such a task is typically accomplished by a recursive 
method of the Tree structure. A mere typical approach will force a multithreaded 
application to block reads of the structure. GHash is non typical and <strong>
very</strong> fast.</p>
<p>Each algorithm has various properties. Building from a Window64 starting 
point, I re-structured the â€œGoogle Sparse Hashâ€ project source code. I made 
major structure changes to the code. This may be the answer to a commented 
question in the source code about an empty bucket. I added struct support for 
Windows, fully redesigned the build, and provide a 64 bit target for Windows 
which the â€œSparse Hash Projectâ€ does not. The work is in the file <em>
GSparseHash.h</em>. It will be the file of interest in this release , and 
admittedly it is still a work in progress. It is a starting point. That one file 
stands as an exception in the XMLFoundation because it does not yet build under 
every compiler. It&#39;s MUCH simpler to incorporate into any build as the inlined 
implementation in GSparshHash.h (where the compiler supports) - and I expect 
only minor changes for GCC to support GSparseHash.h</p><p>Although GHash is not 
a Distributed Data Structure, it is a far more valuable algorithmic component 
within a â€œDistributed Data Structureâ€ than CityHash. Just as GHash is made 
of many algorithmic components so must a structure like BigTable designed and 
used by Google, which is likely where CityHash is used. BigTable is best defined 
as a sparse, distributed multi-dimensional sorted map. It is accurately 
summarized here: <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/content/bigtable.html">
http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~pxk/417/notes/content/bigtable.html</a>.</p>
<p>Boom. Bust. Readjust. Ashes to Ashes. Dust to Dust. In God we Trust. Watch 
the Bubble sort Bust. </p>

<h2><a name="Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>
<p>The ongoing commentating and documenting of the source code is always 
improving the usability of this powerful set of tools. The tools are getting 
even more powerful. Many comments were added into the source code in response to 
questions that people have asked. As I answer questions, I put those answers in 
strategic places in the source code in the form of a comment that will prevent 
others from having the same issue in question.</p>
<p>You can always search through the XMLFoundation library source code on almost 
any method in any G class and within the XMLFoundation you will find a usage 
example to compliment the documentation in comments above each method.  </p>
<p>If a picture is worth a thousand words, an example is worth ten thousand. 
&quot;Open Source&quot; projects are frequently unsupported and undocumented, however you 
will find that the ongoing commentating of source code is continuously being 
maintained and developed to make the toolkit more useful and productive in the 
hands of people who are new to using it. The detailed documentation is all in 
the source code, right where you need it. For example a comment was just 
recently added into ListAbstraction.h just above the StringCollectionAbstraction 
class that explains how that base class is used to store ANY data type into ANY 
data structure. That comment links to a new class called CDoubleArrayAbstraction 
in AbstractionsMFC.h that stores the data type &quot;double&quot; into MFC&#39;s array 
implementation called CArray. While the implementation was the point of interest 
of one person, the comments added will be the point of interest to even more 
people that need some other data type in some other kind of data structure.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Sexy_GString">The Sexy GString</a></h2>
<p>The GString is ancient. Before the GString, xmlLex used ostream. The ONLY 
reason GString was initially created was to out-perform ostream. This is why 
GString has two identical methods Write() and write(). ostream uses a lowercase 
write(). In our application(s) that used ostream we simply commented out the 
ostream instance and replace it with a GString of the same variable name. If 
GString did not have a lowercase write(), you would have to hunt through your 
code and replace all the places you called write() and change it to Write() 
making it difficult to change something at such a low level, it is underneath 
the XML Parser. If you understand what ostream is, then you understand what 
GString is. If they were both clothing they would be found in the same 
department next to MFC&#39;s CString. The GString is way sexier. It exposes parts 
that ostream and CString keep private.</p>
<p>The big &#39;hack&#39; in GString that makes it so fast, is that it makes no heap 
allocation unless your data grows beyond 64 bytes. It may sound like a small 
thing, but it&#39;s the hack that fills the crack. In this document I already wrote 
about how important <a href="#Custom_Memory_Management">memory management</a> 
is. GString applies the same concept of heap avoidance to use the faster stack 
space if possible, or by including some &#39;data&#39; space in the &#39;object&#39; space. This 
means when you instantiate a GString it eats up an &#39;extra&#39; 64 bytes just incase 
you might use it. If you use more than the 64 bytes, you will be punished by 
waiting for the slower heap allocation. If you put no data in the GString, then 
you needlessly preallocated memory that you never used and your punishment was 
that you are holding a lock on unused memory that perhaps is needed elsewhere. 
It&#39;s all about memory vs. speed tradeoffs.</p>
<p>Very recently XMLFoundation added GString0, and GString32. The number 
represents the bytes of &#39;extra&#39; space used to avoid the heap allocation. If you 
expect that a GString value will be empty 99% of the time and you expect many 
instances of that normally empty GString will exist at the same time, you may 
choose to use GString0, which makes no initial stack allocation, your 
application will then use less memory and run a little slower only when the 1% 
of the exceptions come around. The GString is a GString64, but we just call it 
GString.</p>
<p>Another major performance area of the GString is in the resize() method, the 
reallocation algorithm is very simple. The size of the buffer is doubled 
whenever it would otherwise grow beyond it&#39;s current allocation bounds. 
Alternatively the allocation space can grow by a block size, that approach is 
generally an order of magnitude slower in a preallocated GString. GString 
supports both allocation styles, but it defaults to doubling the current buffer 
size. The worst case scenario for the size doubling is: If you have 4 GB in a 
GString and only need to fit one more byte you might have to allocate 8GB for a 
GString that will never grow beyond 4GB + 1 byte. You can always preallocate 4GB 
+ 1 byte if you know that will be the final size, then you can avoid all this 
performance oriented guesswork with the fastest implementation possible. Many 
times the final size is unknown until it is final.</p>
<p>If the GString was ALL about performance it would be of little interest 
beyond an internal tool needed by a performance orientated XML Parser, however 
the GString is plenty robust, filled with common needs in a wide array of 
applications, the interfaces are fully document in GString.h, here is a summary: 
I left out all the typical String methods like Mid() Left() Right(), Upper() 
Compare*() and many others, see GString .h for complete documentation.</p><pre lang="cs">// write() appends to the GString to mimic ostream

<h2><a name="Threading">Threading</a></h2>
<p>The new GThread, first of all, is a Windows thing. Inspired by that &quot;designed 
for each other&quot; concept. Windows Mobile, Windows 32, Windows 64, and Windows 
Phone all need a pthread interface (POSIX Threads) for ServerCore, and for the 
thread synchronization within XMLFoundation caching. iOS, Linux, Android, AIX, 
Solaris, and HPUX all have an official pthread implementation. Microsoft decided 
not to be bound to the POSIX standard. I guess you cant be a leader if you 
always follow. Windows Run Time (aka managed .NET code or WinRT) has a 
completely different threading model besides the Win32 threading model . I 
needed a pthread interface for WinRT and I was forced to build my own - but the 
vast majority of the work was already complete thanks to a combination of Win32 
PThreads, the implementation from John E. Bossom and the publication of 
&quot;namespace ThreadEmulation&quot; Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  <em>
GThread.cpp</em> works on all Windows platforms. It is NOT intended to implement 
the whole of POSIX threads - only the small subset necessary within the 
XMLFoundation code. This is a clearly defined abstract interface (defined with 
#defines) in <em>GThread.h</em>. This better positions XMLFoundation to further 
customize GThread.cpp which unlike the previously used <em>PThread.cpp</em> 
(which was &quot;designed&quot; to implement POSIX), GThread is &quot;designed&quot; for the needs 
of XMLFoundation. As was the case between the ObjectFactory and the XML Parser - 
being designed for each other makes all the difference in the world. If you can 
do it better than the standard, I guess its time to quit following that 
standard. I suspect GThread will someday further optimize the integration to 
BOTH Windows threading models to make the most of a fully native solution. For 
example, consider this code snipped from <em>xmlDefines.h</em> that uses a 
native threading optimization for Windows.</p>

<p><em>PThread.cpp</em> is still included incase you need it, but it is now 
unused by the XMLFoundation and several applications I have built upon it.</p>

<h2><a name="GProfile_-_The_App_Registry">GProfile - The App Registry</a></h2>
<p>If you have ever built an application that stores and retrieves &quot;Application 
Settings&quot;, You had a situation where you could have used GProfile. On Windows, 
it is popular to put your application configuration settings in the Windows 
Registry. There are reasons not to do that, however it is a practice that dates 
back to 16 bit Windows 3.1 development when Charles Petzold documented and 
exemplified the Windows API. Even back then, it was popular to add your own 
[Section] into the WIN.INI file. The WIN.INI file stored &quot;Application Settings&quot; 
for Windows such as wallpaper settings and other user preferences. The Windows 
API allowed you to write in WIN.INI - so did notepad.exe</p>
<p>There are some advantages to writing your configuration settings in a file 
that is not managed by the operating system. It becomes portable to Linux and 
iOS as well as Windows. It becomes very simple to move configurations from 
machine to machine when the &quot;Application Settings&quot; are in a file rather than all 
over in the registry. It also becomes very easy to manage multiple 
configurations, by maintaining multiple versions of the configuration file. It&#39;s 
not so simple to copy a snapshot of the Windows registry and switch between 
versions. You can easily do that with GProfile.</p>
<p>GProfile also allows you to encrypt your application configuration settings. 
You could encrypt individual keys in the registry, that would require a bit more 
code and work than if you were to use GProfile. The Windows Registry has an API 
called RegNotifyChangeKeyValue(), this will allow your application to be 
notified when an external source has changed a value. GProfile has a method 
called RegisterChangeNotification() that does the same thing. Additionally you 
can easily switch between INI format or XML format to store your &quot;Application 
Settings&quot;, settings stored in the registry are not so easily exported to a .REG 
file - a far cry from simple INI or open XML like the GProfile supports.</p>
<p>The GProfile is ancient, like the GString.&nbsp; In fact not until may of 
2014 were the last of the C++ &quot;short&quot; datatypes converted to &quot;bool&quot;.&nbsp; When 
GProfile was first written not all C++ compilers supported &#39;bool&#39;, or they just 
defined it as a short, so now GProfile uses more modern and intuitive syntax.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The following are a few of the method interfaces to GProfile.</p>

<h2><a name="Windows_Phone">Windows Phone</a></h2>
<p>Building the Windows Phone Example is very simple once you have the 
development environment setup. The WP8 Emulator is Hyper-V, so you need to have 
a Core i5 or i7 CPU that has Intel VT-x/EPT to see anything work. You will also 
need Win 8 Pro or Enterprise. Install the Windows Phone SDK after installing 
VS2012 ( or select the Windows Phone Development option during the install of 
VS2013 ). Under the Examples folder, open the solution for Windows Phone, build 
and run it on the emulator. The example application does the same thing as the 
example for iPhone - It shows how to deal with XML, and it starts an HTTP server 
on the phone using <em>ServerCore.cpp</em>.</p>

<h2><a name="iPhone_/_iOS">iPhone / iOS</a></h2>
<p>The port to iOS is complete. The XMLFoundation concepts work beautifully in 
Objective C++. I added a new example program called ObjectiveObjects that shows 
how to use all the C++ examples in Objective C++. The example added for iOS is 
more complete than the example for Android, in that it documents converting XML 
to Objects. Like the Android example, the iOS example also shows how to use <em>
ServerCore.cpp</em> to create an HTTP server on the phone. All of the code of 
interest in the new example is found in the file 
<em>ViewController.m</em>. Here is a bit of that file:</p>

<h2><a name="Android">Android</a></h2>
<p>An Android sample program was added that displays a simple GUI from Java that 
uses ServerCore.cpp to build an HTTP server application. You will find this 
documentation in the source download.  <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=D7EC275E76D295CF%21560">

<p>Although the Android example focused on the use of ServerCore.cpp and did not 
make use of the XML-to-Object code - all that code is fully ported to Android. 
Android is where the JavaXMLFoundation should be used to process XML in a native 
binary that uses JNI for the object bindings so that the developer has a pure 
Java experience, and faster XML processing. And finally about Android, naturally 
if your object model is built with the Android NDK then you can fully make use 
of the C++ XMLFoundation and all the Object-to-XML features on Android.</p>
<p>If you will be working with the Android source, you will likely want to see 
XMLFoundation in action. I wrote to MajorGeeks.com , Slashdot.org , 
TechCrunch.com, Tucows.com about my work on Android during this port of the

<h2><a name="64_Bit_Design_32_Bit_Support">64 Bit Design 32 Bit Support</a></h2>
<p>The December 21, 2012 build extended and widened the library interfaces with 
emphasis on the future in software design, and even style. XMLFoundation maps 
the data in raw XML to lists, arrays, strings, ints, and even int64&#39;s in the 
application layer. All of these data types have been supported for over a decade 
already. New interfaces in the 2012 version support mapping char(1 byte), 
short(2 bytes), and char buf[n bytes] to fully complete the mapping to every 
native C++ data type. The foundational GString is now indexed by 64 bit 
addressing which pushes all xml document size limitations into almost infinity. 
This long addressing scheme has been added in such a way that 32 bit 
applications will still use 64 bit addressing granting them the bounds of 
infinity as well. Benchmark tests confirm that XMLFoundation is the fastest 
approach for moving XML into the application layer. The overhead of pushing an 
extra 4 bytes on the call stack during tokenization is measurable but 
insignificant in light of all the stack operations eliminated by using a custom 
non SAX interface to the XML parser (Read details in the &#39;Faster than Fast&#39; 
section). On 64 bit systems there is no performance penalty to pay at all since 
the registers are 64 bits wide already.</p><p align="left">The GString is such a 
sexy article of engineering that it gets used to hold all types of streamed data 
in an application, not just XML. By design, the GString replaced ostream which 
the tokenizer (aka -the lexical analyzer or the XML Parser) was initially built 
with. By overloading the &lt;&lt; operator it was a very simple task to port this work 
to a better stream class. In the times of 2012 we now deal with file sizes and 
offsets that require 64bit indexing on the average or above average home 
computer. Granted it will be many years before the average home computer 
allocates contiguous regions of memory that large - but high end servers do it 
already and they have registers that are 64 bits wide. To keep GString 
positioned to serve mankind in ALL situations it now uses a 64 bit index. Target 
the future.  



</p><p align="left">A 32 bit test parsed xml containing element and attribute 
tags mapped to various lists, string and integers. This was executed while 
counting cpu cycles using the assembly code in <em>GPerformanceProfile.cpp</em> 
for these results running in a native 32 bit operating system that is not under 
WOW or virtualization:



</p><p align="left">Tokenizing with a 64 bit index in the new XMLFoundation 32 
bit build on a 32 bit OS: (176,121) CPU cycles



</p><p align="left">Tokenizing with a 32 bit index in the old XMLFoundation 32 
bit build on a 32 bit OS: (170,144) CPU cycles



</p><p align="left">By merely widening the integer index at the lowest level of 
the XML parser it caused the machine code produced by the C++ compiler to PUSH 
and POP more data onto the stack, hence it now takes more CPU cycles to process 
the same amount of XML. If you understand what caused the difference, then you 
can understand why the XMLFoundation is preferable to SAX if you want the 
fastest solution. Truly this is the fastest solution on earth for processing XML 
in 32 bit, even though it is now optimized for 64 bit. The fastest solution will 
be the one selected to process the largest XML data sets in the world because 
the decision will be made by an engineer not a politician. Those data sets will 
need this very large indexing scheme. Smaller data sets no longer need to worry 
that some freak occurrence (an exception) might (however unlikely) surpass 32 
bit indexing thresholds. English words fail to express what raw numbers so 
emphatically and eloquently assert is the fastest way to process XML. Aside from 
all this raw horsepower produced through efficient algorithmic design, the 
application source code that uses XML is organized and simple.

<h2><a name="XML_in_the_Foundation">XML in the Foundation</a></h2>
<p>As the name suggests it provides a foundation for XML support in an 
application, however this is much more than just another XML parser. It applies 
a unique approach to handling XML that allows your application code to focus on 
the application rather than traversing DOM or subscribing to SAX events. The 
most unique feature of the XMLFoundation is the object oriented encapsulation 
that provides XML support in the application layer. XMLFoundation allows you to 
easily integrate XML with your GUI, or with your server objects, and it natively 
supports COM, DCOM, and CORBA objects.</p>
<p>XMLFoundation contains a small, fast, and portable XML tokenizer that has 
been refined and optimized in many large software projects. My involvement with 
XML pre-dates the finalization of the XML 1.0 recommendation by W3C. For years, 
the only XML Parser that could match XMLFoundation tokenization performance was 
&quot;Xpat&quot; by James Clark - but as you will see the unique ability to bypass DOM and 
SAX altogether makes XMLFoundation the fastest solution available for moving XML 
to and from application layer objects - and it requires far less lines of code 
to do it.</p>
<p>
The performance of the stack based XML parser is at the top of its class for 
non-validating parsers. Parsing and tokenization is only half the task, the 
other half is getting the results into the member variables, lists, and objects 
that they need to be in to be useful in the application layer - it is in that 
task that XMLFoundation is in a class of its own. The performance is 
unparalleled because the memory buffer that contains the source XML parses 
directly into your custom class objects without ever being copied or temporarily 
stored in a DOM tree. It parses directly into your lists, objects, arrays, 
indexed data structures, and all native C++ data types. It even has support for 
common containers of element data such as MFC CStrings. It&#39;s been used in Java 
too. That said, speed of execution is less impressive than the speed of 
development and overall reduction in lines of code required to effectively use 
XML in your application.</p>
<p>XML is in the Foundation, but the foundation does much more than just XML. It 
is also a web services framework implemented in ServerCore.cpp. It can be 
extended several ways for HTTP as well as for other protocols. This allows you 
to to build your application on a multi-threaded server blueprint that has been 
used on many platforms and it has been used to build servers that are not even 
XML based, but needless to say it works great for building an XML based server. 
The services framework supports a unique design approach for both static and 
dynamic server extensions and examples of both - but XMLFoundation does even 
more than XML and Web Services.</p>
<h2><a name="The_Solid_Foundation">The Solid Foundation</a></h2>
<p>
If you are building an application that does not use XML and never will..... 
XMLFoundation is still a very valuable tool available to solve many very common 
development tasks. The data structure classes alone ( List, Hash, Stack, Tree, 
Array, QSort ) are very useful. They all have &quot;<a href="http://www.oodesign.com/iterator-pattern.html">Iterator</a>&quot; 
objects so that data structures can be read-referenced by multiple threads at 
the same time without blocking. The interface is standard to all data 
structures. If you find MFC or Rogue Wave Standard C++ library data structures 
useful, you will likely find XMLFoundation data structures even more so.</p>
<p>XMLFoundation also has standard algorithm implementations ( Encryption, 
Compression, Data hash, Encoding ). These are based on the works of other 
authors. They have been included into the XMLFoundation in a simplified build 
format. They all compile under C++, so if you are using them on AS/400, AIX, 
Solaris, Linux, or other like platforms - you do not even need to reference a C 
compiler from the makefile, only your C++ compiler. They are also organized into 
single .CPP files for each implementation - often a consolidation of many 
individual C source files in the original authors publications.</p>
<p>XMLFoundation also has a plethora of application utilities including ( Sorts, 
Performance Timers, Disk Directory, Exceptions, INI Profiles, Caching, String, 
Stream ). XMLFoundation has many utilities that MFC does not. They are complete, 
comment documented with examples, and thoroughly tested on many software 
projects.</p>
<p>XMLFoundation is very portable. It builds on all versions of Windows (Win95 
through Windows8 and Windows Mobile). Portions were initially developed on a 
RISC machine, and it was used in Solaris and Linux as early as 2001. Some of the 
compilers that have been used to build XMLFoundation include: CC5.0, Xlc, <strong> </strong>
IntelC++, KAIc++, ForteC++, Visual C++, Borland C++, and eMc++. However I 
believe it works with any C++ compiler <a href="http://www.compilerconnection.com/companies/companies.htm">
found here</a>, because it does not use namespaces, iostreams, or STL - all 
areas that are prone to porting problems from my experience. It does have 
template classes but their inclusion is optional as part of the implementation 
rather than part of the foundation. XMLFoundation and all the sample 
applications have recently been built and verified on Ubuntu and Fedora. The 
source is distributed with VC6 makefiles so that the source can be imported into 
projects using every version of the Microsoft compilers from 1998 through Visual 
Studio 2010. Now the source includes a Visual Studio 2012 project file with 32 
and 64 bit targets defined.</p>
<p>The build dependencies are meticulously correct. Smart linkers leave out 
everything you don&#39;t use, so don&#39;t expect to see code bloat as a punishment for 
using XMLFoundation. Other development libraries were not designed as well from 
a build perspective. Your application will not load any DLL&#39;s as a result of 
using the XMLFoundation.   <a href="http://cid-d7ec275e76d295cf.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Software/Xfer%20Eval.zip">
Xfer is another project I manage</a> that is built on the XMLFoundation for the 
platform independence - the code is tight and the product(s) built on 
XMLFoundation reflect that.</p>
<p>I suppose an entire article could be written about each of the foundational 
classes, and I&#39;m certain that they will be written. They are all well commented 
and coded with a highly experienced approach. The String class uses stack space 
when possible to avoid heap allocations. It&#39;s the best string implementation 
I&#39;ve ever seen. The INI Profile class uses triggers that allows your application 
to pick up real-time configuration changes much like <code>
RegNotifyChangeKeyValue()</code> in the Windows SDK. Exceptions can be 
configured to unwind the call stack to a memory buffer like Java&#39;s <code>
printStackTrace()</code>. The Tree has an iterator. The Directory can delete 
recursively - on all platforms. The Stack is entirely inline, with standard and 
macro methods - It could not be any faster if it was coded directly in assembly. 
The <code>StringList</code> puts MFC&#39;s <code>CStringList</code> to shame, just 
look at the interfaces. The GHash puts Microsoft&#39;s <code>CMapStringToPtr</code> 
to shame. It is <em>unspeakably</em>  faster. Look at the &quot;MFCTypesFromXML&quot; 
example and see for yourself.</p>
<h2><a name="History_and_Future">History and Future</a></h2>
<p>You cannot build a house on foundation of wet cement that has not cured yet. 
With cement, minimizing stress prior to curing minimizes cracking in your 
foundation. The same is true of software. The XMLFoundation is solid and 
completely cured. It would be too bold to say that the XMLFoundation has no bugs 
in, but it has none that I am aware of and the code has been heavily used. It is 
a complete foundation. Building an application on any foundation like Java 1.0 
or .NET 1.0 or anything 1.0 means that if you don&#39;t get slowed down by the bugs, 
you will be slowed down when you find all the missing functionality. This code 
was first released to the public July 4, 2002 - the XMLFoundation was already 
very mature for it&#39;s age - it came from a good family - it&#39;s mother had already 
been used on the largest software project in the world. Since then I have built 
several complex applications on it and many others have as well. It was 
completely stress tested with SMP hardware during a recent Fortune 50 proof of 
concept implementation. XMLFoundation interfaces are well established constants, 
no longer a curing foundation that is still forming.</p>
<p>The mother of the XMLFoundation was &quot;The XML Object Framework&quot;, born in 1998 
and 1999 (it was a long labor) for a client of mine. The XMLFoundation was born 
the following year. The XMLFoundation sported a completely new implementation of 
the xml parser based on the custom GString stream class that was also born in 
2000. XML Journal Magazine reviewed a product built on the early XMLFoundation 
object factorization and called it &quot;5 Star / World Class&quot; in XMLJournal Magazine 
Volume 2 Issue 7 (note: they did not review XMLFoundation they reviewed 
TransactXML). XMLFoundation was heavily developed the following two years before 
it became public in 2002. This project is mature and stable.</p>
<p>XMLFoundation absolutely IS the future in certain technology subsets. It is a 
gift to the world of engineering, and it comes with all the source code. 
Universities that want to teach algorithms, applications, or OO Design will find 
the XMLFoundation to be a great source code to base a curriculum on. Independent 
authors who want to write about cutting edge technology will find XMLFoundation 
a worthy subject. The future was written in the past.</p>
<h2><a name="The_Need_for_Objects_from_XML_">The Need for Objects from XML</a></h2>
<p>XML is data. â€œObjects from dataâ€ is not a new concept. Programmers have 
been doing that for years, even before they were called objects. We still need 
to get data into objects today. The data can be XML or a result set, and the 
object might be a CDialog, a CORBA Object, a COM object, or your own invention. 
You still need to get the same thing done. Programmers have been doing this as 
long as there have been programmers.</p>
<p>If you apply enough force you can make the cube fit into the round hole. If 
you apply enough force you can do anything - even police California. The brute 
force approach is to parse the XML into a DOM tree, and traverse the tree to 
gather the data required by application/object variables. This approach causes 
volumes of â€œsimpleâ€ source code to move data from XML into Structured 
Objects, a poor approach with respect to implementation time and long term 
maintenance.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the OO approach generalizes this process into reusable 
functionality that enables objects to serialize to and from XML directly. OO is 
pronounced ohhh-ohhh - and it is short for Object Oriented (incase you didn&#39;t 
know) - it&#39;s poetic tech lingo - a code of it&#39;s own.</p>
<p>
Software developers of every language have a similar need. They must either:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li>Write their own Object-XML tools,</li>
<li>Find some production quality framework ready to use or,</li>
<li>Use brute force and budget for maintenance programmers.</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="Best_of_Breed">Best of Breed</a></h2>
<p>We can mostly rule out option A because it takes a lot of time and the 
purpose of the project is to build product not tools. Option C is also unwise if 
you have any long term plans for your product or want to be able to quickly add 
new features. Option B leaves several paths and it wouldn&#39;t be right for me to 
toot my own horn and tell you that XMLFoundation is the best option available in 
the entire software industry to accomplish this fundamental task - so I 
encourage you to research this yourself and I expect that you will agree 
XMLFoundation is not just the best free solution, it&#39;s the best solution.</p>
<p>It&#39;s difficult to directly compare XMLFoundation to other solutions because 
the utilities in XMLFoundation, and many of the features in XMLFoundation are 
not found in other solutions. That said, here is a starting point for your own 
research:</p>
<p>Microsoft developed the &quot;Xml.<code>Serialization.XmlSerializer</code>&quot;, for 
C# but it only supports shallow serialization(no nested or complex objects) and 
it lacks many other features found in the XMLFoundation. I would wager that even 
the limited support it does provide is slower than XMLFoundation but I have not 
put the two technologies to a speed comparison.</p>
<p>IBM Developer Works has posted 2 or more XML Serialization libraries but they 
are based on an external XML Parser - so by nature of their design they must be 
slower.</p>
<p>The list goes <a href="http://www.rpbourret.com/xml/XMLDataBinding.htm#xmlfoundation">
on, and on, and on, and on</a> of likeminded solutions.</p>

<p>The<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> repetition in red</span> 
filled the hole in to make non-square data be square. The data in red is 
normally a pointer reference to the last sort break at the DBMS kernel level, 
but various toolsets often expand it long form so that 1 instance of a &quot;<span style="background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">Row</span>&quot; 
object does not rely on the data in another instance. It&#39;s a terrible situation 
that has plagued applications for as long as I can remember. The problem is that 
in reality there is no such thing as a &quot;<span style="background-color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">Row</span>&quot; 
object - it was more of a temporary/tool-object to get the data into real 
objects like <span style="background-color: rgb(128, 0, 128);">Customers, Orders 
and LineItems.</span>  Countless data access products in the form of VBX, OCX, 
ActiveX and various frameworks and libraries serve up square data sets to 
applications that MANUALLY code the transfer of data into their application 
objects with volumes of code that looked something like this:</p>
<p><img width="610" height="442" alt="PseudoCode.jpg" src="PseudoCode.jpg" border="0" hspace="0" /></p>
<p>Notice all the use of <code><span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);">
Tool</span></code> that represents some sort of data set tool, class or library. 
Building software to accomplish this task of copying data into objects without 
such a tool would dramatically increase the lines of code required to move the 
square dataset into your application objects. Knowing what tools to use can be 
the difference between the success or failure of an entire project. One bad 
tool, or one missing tool can make all the difference in the world to a software 
developer.</p>

<p>There is nothing square about XML. XML is an <a href="http://www.brpreiss.com/books/opus5/html/page257.html">
N-airy tree</a>. That&#39;s why we naturally use DOM (Document Object Model) to 
traverse the data. For 1000&#39;s of years we thought that the world was flat. 
Engineers made it be square because that was easier for them to cope with and 
now we live in the days where it begins to take it&#39;s true shape. Unfortunately 
as of 2010, the opportunity of the paradigm data shape shift has not been 
harnessed by most programmers that grew up in the square world and are only 
familiar with square tools. They take the most obvious development path. If you 
presented the problem of sorting to someone who has no tools, they will likely 
build a &quot;bubble sort&quot; - because that is the most obvious and immediate solution.</p>
<p>Typically the XML is parsed into a tree structure. This means that the linear 
and contiguous memory buffer of source XML is <strong>copied</strong> into many 
fragmented pieces of memory across the heap - each element and in many cases 
each token gets it&#39;s own heap space. This makes the XML elements and attributes 
programmatically accessible with loops and recursion, just like Tool did for 
square datasets. The XML parser puts the Elements and Attributes into this 
temporary fragmented memory tree structure so that the application programmer 
can get at the information to copy it <strong>once more</strong>
into a final structure that can be displayed on the GUI or used by the 
application. It is likely going to take as much or more code to get from the 
temporary DOM tree into the objects as it did to get from the square result set 
into the objects. In many cases it will require recursion that is difficult to 
debug - much more difficult than the old fashioned iterative code required to 
copy from square result sets. Below is a code sample of some common tasks:</p>
<pre lang="C++">//Due to the large amount of code to change a DOM node name this article only 
//    includes the basic steps involved.  This is what it takes to change an element

-------------------------------------------------------
// 1. create a new node with the desired tag name 
// 2. preserve old value to copy later 
// 3. move all children of current node to new node 
// 4. get parent of current node and replaceChild the current node with the new node 
// 5. copy old value or new value to new node 
// NOTE: Attributes are handled differently! 

// This is how to add a new attribute using DOM

_bstr_t bstrAttrValue = (LPCTSTR)m_strValue;
pNewAttr-&gt;PutnodeValue((_variant_t)bstrAttrValue);
pAttrList-&gt;setNamedItem(pNewAttr);
// TODO: The user must first search to be sure the attribute name is unique, or your XML will be invalid! 
// One of the well-formedness constraints that the XML 1.0 specification lists is that no attribute name  
// may appear more than once in the same start tag or empty element tag.  DOM never deals with this issue. 
// XML is case sensitive, so attribute &quot;Name&quot; is different from attribute &quot;name&quot;, some tools built into DOM 
// sure would have been useful - good thing we have the XMLFoundation. 
AddNodeToTree(pNewAttr, m_hCurItem);</pre>
<h2><a name="New_World_Order">New World Order</a></h2>
<p>The square world is becoming part of history like the flat world. I remember 
back in the early 90&#39;s we tried to rid ourselves of the square world with 
something called &quot;The Object Database&quot;. It was a great concept and the only 
reason square prevailed against it is because nobody could implement an Object 
Database that was fast enough. Who cares how clean the code is if the 
application is dysfunctional because it is too slow? This is why XMLFoundation 
is so performance oriented - that&#39;s what it takes to change the world. The clean 
code alone is not enough.</p>
<p>Now I&#39;ll explain how to accomplish the task of loading up your object with 
the information in the XML using a fully object oriented approach to data 
handling. Customer, Order, and LineItem are derived from <code>XMLObject</code>. 
They must implement 1 virtual method called 
<code>MapMembers()</code> 
that would look like this:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void Customer::MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
    MapMember(&amp;m_OrderList, Order::GetStaticTag());
    MapAttribute(&amp;m_nCustomerID, &quot;id&quot;);
    MapMember(&amp;m_strName, &quot;Name&quot;);
}
void Order::MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
    MapAttribute(&amp;m_nOrderID, &quot;id&quot;);
    MapMember(&amp;m_LineItemList, LineItem::GetStaticTag());
    MapMember(&amp;m_strDate, &quot;Date&quot;);    // can also be mapped to a date/time object
}
void LineItem::MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
    MapAttribute(&amp;m_nLineItemID, &quot;id&quot;);
    MapMember(&amp;m_strDesc, &quot;Desc&quot;);
    MapMember(&amp;m_strPrice, &quot;Price&quot;);    
}</pre>
<p>Now all the object assignment and creation code is summed up into this one 
line.</p>
<pre lang="cs">// This assigns ALL member variables and creates sub-objects. 
Customers.FromXML( pzXML )</pre>
<p>If you had a trace statement in the constructor of the Order, you would see 
that it was called for every appearance of an Order in the XML.</p>
<p>Now suppose you wanted to manipulate some member variables then regenerate 
the XML: just assign your member variables normally then regenerate your XML - 
that&#39;s just as easy.</p>
<pre lang="C++">char *pzXML = Order.ToXML()</pre>
<p><code>MapXMLTagsToMembers()</code> defines everything needed for your objects 
to <em>read</em>
or <em>write</em> XML as a base method. Without the XMLFoundation you would have 
to code all that looping and mapping 2 times if you wanted both reading and 
writing XML. Without the XMLFoundation you will have a larger maintenance issue 
if any XML document structure changes because you&#39;ll have to hunt through your 
looping and recursion routines to find the Element name to change. XMLFoundation 
provides countless other niceties such as mapping any number of XML tags to the 
same member, and conditional inclusion of members in the output XML based on tag 
name or the member state such as DIRTY indicating that the member was updated 
and you only want <code>ToXML()</code> to generate a delta of the data rather 
than the entire set. You can specify element order or have them output 
alphabetically. Common needs that can all be accomplished in 1 line of code 
rather than pages of code.</p>
<pre lang="C++">//The following code is so involved using DOM only the basic steps are described.
//This is what it takes to change an element tag name using XMLFoundation.
-------------------------------------------------------
// This is how backward compatibility is achieved when Element tag
// names change. For example, if m_nVersion is mapped to an Element
// named &quot;VersionNumber&quot; but you want all future protocols to refer to this 
// Element as to &quot;ProtocolVersion&quot;. This is achieved by the following code:
// This allows either &quot;VersionNumber&quot; or &quot;ProtocolVersion&quot; to set the value of 
// m_nVersion, but always refers to it as &quot;ProtocolVersion&quot; while serializing XML.
MapMember(&amp;m_nVersion,&quot;VersionNumber&quot;);
MapMember(&amp;m_nVersion,&quot;ProtocolVersion&quot;);
SetMemberSerialize(&quot;VersionNumber&quot;, false );


// This is how to add a new attribute using XMLFoundation 
// if nUpdate=1 the attribute list will be searched and updated if there is an existing 
// attribute called [pzName]if not found or if nUpdate=0 the new attribute will be added.
void AddAttribute( const char * pzName, const char * pzValue, int nUpdate=0 );</pre>
<p>It&#39;s fun to compare the differences between DOM and XMFoundation, but much of 
the functionality in the XMLFoundation cannot be compared to anything in DOM. 
For example, the XMLFoundation maintains a bit flag field for each member that 
it manages. These are the values that can be managed:</p>
<pre lang="C++">// The value does not sync with the original value set by the Object Factory
#define DATA_DIRTY 0x01 
// The member has been set by either the Object or the Object Factory.
#define DATA_NOT_NULL 0x02

<h2><a name="Faster_than_Fast">Faster than Fast</a></h2>
<p>The approach used by XMLFoundation is faster than SAX. Since the object 
factory and the XML tokenizer were built for each other they did some unusual 
tricks for each other. The tokenizer uses a unique approach to begin with. It&#39;s 
purely pointer based. Tokens are structures that point into the source XML, 
except for entities that get expanded into a special memory region. Tokens do 
not hold copies of any data. During object factorization it becomes necessary to 
have the token data in a null terminated string format. The big performance 
boosting hack is that to obtain null terminated strings, the tokenizer actually 
plunks a null down over the first byte past the end of the token data. It keeps 
track of the data it clobbers and restores it before parsing out the next token. 
There are no event calls that needlessly push data on the stack just to 
immediately pop it back off. Performance profilers showed that call stack pushes 
and pops were the single largest consumer of CPU cycles in the tokenization 
process. XMLFoundation eliminates them by &quot;pulling&quot; the data through a call to [<code>void 
getToken(token *tok)</code>], rather than the SAX approach that gets the data 
&quot;pushed&quot; into the application events with between 2 and 7 arguments depending on 
the token type. SAX would be the fastest approach if the XMLFoundation did not 
exist. The XMLFoundation is the only XML parser that uses this approach. It is 
non-standard, and not in compliance with W3C interfaces to an XML Parser - For 
our uses, It&#39;s better than any W3C standard.</p>
<p>I realize that the vast majority of people who use XMLFoundation would never 
care about these grungy technical details. To say that it is very fast is enough 
for most people, but I am also writing to the people at the Apache Foundation, 
and Microsoft, and IBM, W3C, and the many other people who have built their own 
XML Parser implementations. Fast is an understatement. Performance is a 
prevailing design pattern found throughout the XMLFoundation. For example the <code>
XMLObject</code> class is carefully designed to add minimal CPU cycles during 
construction because it is to the XMLFoundation what <code>CObject</code> is to 
MFC. It has been carefully designed to add minimal entries to the virtual method 
table. In many cases virtual calls were consolidated for that purpose.</p>
<h2><a name="Object_Factorization">Object Factorization</a></h2>
<p>The Object Factory is the part of the XMLFoundation that instantiates objects 
for you based on certain element tags in the source XML. It is based on the same 
principle as <code>DECLARE_DYNCREATE()</code> that allows MFC to instantiate 
CView derived classes for you. In the XMLFoundation it is called 
<code>DECLARE_FACTORY()</code>. The XMLFoundation uses this macro to instantiate 
COM and CORBA objects as well.</p>
<p>Every object that derives from <code>XMLObject</code> must have 1 macro in 
the class definition, the DECLARE macro, normally in your .h source file. It 
must also have one macro at global space, often in the .cpp file matching the .h 
file - or you may choose to consolidate all of your IMPLEMENT macros in a single 
.cpp file. These macro&#39;s supply the XML tag and &#39;this&#39; object&#39;s name, aka the 
class name. Terminology Note: Within the XMLFoundation the term &#39;tag&#39; is 
&#39;Element Name&#39; and sometimes &#39;Attribute Name&#39;.</p>
<p>These macros write a method that return new instances of &#39;this&#39; object type. 
The address of this global static function is stored in a structure keyed by tag 
name. As the tags are encountered - during the xml parsing - objects are created 
to contain the data that they expect to follow.</p>
<p>If a tag is mapped to an object in a list or tree structure, then every time 
that tag is encountered at the level it is mapped it will create a new instance 
for you and put it in the data structure (list, tree, etc.) you specified with 
all its member variables already assigned from the source XML as you have them 
mapped.</p>
<h2><a name="Member_Mapping">Member Mapping</a></h2>
<p>XMLFoundation has support for mapping to all native C++ data types. It also 
has support for mapping into data container objects. It has specific support for <code>
RWCString</code>, <code>CString</code>, and 
<code>GString</code>, and it&#39;s very easy to add support for others by deriving 
from the class &quot;<code>StringAbstraction</code>&quot; and supplying the pure virtual 
methods that will enable any kind of data container class to interoperate with 
the Object Factory for automatic member assignments. These are the <code>
MemberMap</code> methods in
<code>XMLObject</code>:</p>

<p>So- for example, you may create an object <code>CPlant</code> that like the 
<code>CHuman</code>
 is derived from <code>CLife</code>. A <code>CPlant</code> would contain the 
elements of 
<code>CLife</code> 
(DNA) and of <code>CMatter</code> (Weight) by inheritance.</p>
<p>If each XML message represents a transaction it is wise to map the 
commonalities of all transactions, or groups of transactions into a base class 
that allows derivatives to inherit the base elements of the transaction that 
will only be maintained in one place.</p>
<h2><a name="Object_Model_Navigation_">Object Model Navigation</a></h2>
<p>By using the XMLFoundation you inherit some powerful navigation features that 
can be used to help you debug your application with the 
<code>Dump()</code> member. Because the factory manages all the object 
relationships, a new kind of object navigation arises: objects know their 
creators so an &quot;Order&quot; can know at runtime if it resides inside a list in a 
&quot;Customer&quot;, or some other kind of object, or if it is not contained by another 
object at all. This is what a full <code>Dump()</code> output looks like:</p>

<h2><a name="CORBA_Objects">CORBA Objects</a></h2>
<p>The XMLFoundation was designed and built for CORBA before it ever added any 
support for MFC. If you have a pre-existing CORBA system that needs some XML 
tools you have come to the right place. If you are building a new CORBA system - 
this is best tool available for XML support.</p>
<p>If you have read this document all the way to this point then you will likely 
understand how the XMLFoundation works for CORBA by showing you this tiny piece 
of code:</p>
<pre lang="C++">class CustomerImpl : public virtual CustomerBOAImpl, public virtual XMLObject</pre>
<p>along with the <code>IMPLEMENT_ORB_FACTORY()</code> macro defined in <em>
XMLObject.h</em>, this is how CORBA can natively support the 
<code>FromXML()</code> and <code>ToXML()</code>  by using the XMLFoundation. The 
Object Factory can instantiate your interface objects for you based on the XML.</p>
<p>CORBA implementations can be done in Java or C++. The XMLFoundation supports 
both. CORBA breaks down the language barrier allowing Java applications to 
easily, and natively deal with C++ objects. This example details the creation of 
C++ CORBA objects - The Java implementation is nearly identical further blurring 
the lines between Java/C++ within the same project.</p>
<p>The C++ CORBA implementation will bridge into J2EE Application servers 
everywhere, it will work for any ORB but a few of the most popular ones have 
been tested, and the makefiles are included with the CORBA sample that ships 
with the XMLFoundation. The three makefiles included are for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Borland/Enterprise Studio - Visibroker</li>
<li>IONA/iPortal Enterprise - Orbix</li>
<li>BEA/Weblogic Enterprise - ObjectBroker (works great with Tuxedo 
implementations)</li>
</ul>
<p>This example extends the ORB to provide native XML accessors. The sample 
CORBA application is based around 1 very simple object type. It has a unique 
integer we call a CustomerID and a string we call a CustomerName. Each customer 
may contain 0 to n references to another object of the same type as itself, a <code>
MyCORBAObject</code>. This would model something like a list of Customers that 
were referred by &#39;this&#39; customer.</p>
<h3>The IDL Looks Like This</h3>
<pre lang="C++">module ExCORBA
{
 interface MyCORBAObject
 {
  void getXMLState(out string s);
  void setXMLState(in string s);
  void setState(in string s, in long l);
  void addSubObject(in string s, in long l);
  void delSubObjects();
  MyCORBAObject getSubObjectIOR(in long l);
  void dumpState(out string s);
 };
};</pre>
<h3>Follow this 12 Step Program</h3>
<p>This is a very simple application. The client application makes 12 calls to 
the server. Every even numbered call is exactly the same - it is a call to <code>
getXMLState()</code> to see what&#39;s going on in the server. The client obtains an 
initial IOR from a server serialized IOR upon server startup.</p>
<ol>
<li>Assign some state in a native CORBA call. This is a typical CORBA data 
assignment operation. Two values are set in the object. The client assigns two 
members on the server. The code looks like this on the client:
<pre lang="C++">CustObject1-&gt;setState(&quot;Root&quot;,777);</pre>
</li><li>View the state of the object in XML. This uses the XML accessor to 
return the state of the object. The code looks like this on the client:</li>
<pre>CORBA::String_var s;
CustObject1-&gt;getXMLState(s);</pre>
<p>and looks like this on the server:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void ExCORBAImpl::getXMLState( CORBA::String_out s)
{ 
  const char *p = ToXML();
  s = CORBA::string_dup(p);
}</pre>
<p>and the result XML is this:</p>
<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
   &lt;CustomerID&gt;777&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
  &lt;CustomerName&gt;Root&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;</pre>
<p>The tag names are configured by the <code>ExCORBAImpl</code> object like 
this:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void  ExCORBAImpl::MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
    MapMember(&amp;_nCustID, &quot;CustomerID&quot;);
    MapMember(&amp;_strCustName, &quot;CustomerName&quot;,&amp;gGenericStrHandler);
    MapMember(&amp;m_lstCMyImplObjs, &quot;MyCORBAImpl&quot;,&amp;gGListHandler,0);
}</pre>
<li>Update the state of the object through XML. Step 1 used a typical object 
accessor to assign the state. Step 3 accomplishes the same through XML. The code 
on the client looks like this:</li>
<pre lang="C++">CustObject1-&gt;setXMLState(&quot;&lt;MyCorbaImpl&gt;&lt;CustomerName&gt;SuperUser&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
&lt;/MyCorbaImpl&gt;&quot;);</pre>
<p>On the server the code looks like this:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void ExCORBAImpl::setXMLState( const char* pzXML ) 
{
    FromXML( pzXML );
}</pre>
<li>View the modified object state in XML. This is the exact same code (client 
and server) as Step 2. We&#39;re calling <code>getXMLState()</code> again, and the 
result is:</li>
<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
   &lt;CustomerID&gt;777&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
   &lt;CustomerName&gt;SuperUser&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;</pre>
<li>Add CORBA Sub-Objects through XML. Step 5 is a lot like step 3 where we 
updated the name &quot;root&quot; to &quot;SuperUser&quot; through an XML assignment. This time 
we&#39;ll add an object reference. The client code looks like this:</li>
<pre lang="C++">CustObject1-&gt;setXMLState(
 &quot;&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;&quot; 
       &quot;&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;&quot;
             &quot;&lt;CustomerID&gt;123&lt;/CustomerID&gt;&quot; 
             &quot;&lt;CustomerName&gt;Al Gore&lt;/CustomerName&gt;&quot; 
       &quot;&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;&quot;
       &quot;&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;&quot;
             &quot;&lt;CustomerID&gt;456&lt;/CustomerID&gt;&quot; 
             &quot;&lt;CustomerName&gt;George Bush Jr.&lt;/CustomerName&gt;&quot; 
       &quot;&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;&quot;
 &quot;&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;&quot;);</pre>
<p>and this is the code on the server:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void ExCORBAImpl::setXMLState( const char* pzXML ) 
{
   FromXML( pzXML );
}</pre>
<li>(Exactly like steps 2 and 4) - View the object&#39;s XML state.</li>
<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
   &lt;CustomerID&gt;777&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
   &lt;CustomerName&gt;SuperUser&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
   &lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
 
&lt;CustomerID&gt;123&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
 
&lt;CustomerName&gt;Al Gore&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
   &lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;
   &lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
 
&lt;CustomerID&gt;456&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
 
&lt;CustomerName&gt;George Bush Jr.&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
   &lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;
&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;</pre>
<li>Get a CORBA object reference for object instance 456. On the client the code 
looks like this:</li>
<pre lang="C++">ExCORBA::MyCORBAObject_var CustObject2;
CustObject2 = CustObject1-&gt;getSubObjectIOR(456);</pre>
<p>and on the server we walk the list of objects and return the first one that 
matches the supplied CustomerID like this:</p>
<pre lang="C++">ExCORBA::MyCORBAObject_ptr ExCORBAImpl::getSubObjectIOR(CORBA::Long CustomerID)
{
  // create an iterator[it] for the [m_lstCMyImplObjs] list 
  GListIterator it(&amp;m_lstCMyImplObjs);
  while(it()) // while there is more in the list 
  {
       XMLObject *pO = (XMLObject *)it++; // get the next Customer Interface 
       ExCORBAImpl*pIO = (ExCORBAImpl*)pO-&gt;GetInterfaceObject(); // widen the pointer 
       
        // test for a match - Use a keyed datastructure in the real world 
        if (pIO-&gt;GetCustomerID() == CustomerID)  
       {
            // Return the CORBA Interface to the desired object 
              return pIO-&gt;_this();
            break;
       }
  }
  return 0;
}</pre>
<li>Exactly like steps (2, 4, and 6) EXCEPT we are using the Object ref returned 
by step 7.</li>
<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
  &lt;CustomerID&gt;456&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
  &lt;CustomerName&gt;GeorgeBush Jr.&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;</pre>
<li>Add a Sub-Object without using XML. In the same way we used a traditional 
member assignment in step 1, we can create a new object reference to demonstrate 
the two models seamlessly working together. On the client:</li>
<pre lang="C++">CustObject1-&gt;addSubObject(&quot;Michelangelo&quot;,1475);</pre>
<p>and on the server the code looks like this:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void ExCORBAImpl::addSubObject( const char* s, CORBA::Long l )
{
   ExCORBAImpl *p = new ExCORBAImpl;
   p-&gt;_nCustID = l;
   p-&gt;_strCustName = s;
   m_lstCMyImplObjs.AddLast((XMLObject *)p);
}</pre>
<li> Get an object reference to the object created in step 9 and display it&#39;s 
state in XML. This is the client code:</li>
<pre lang="C++">CustObject2 = CustObject1-&gt;getSubObjectIOR(1475); // exactly like step 7 
CustObject2-&gt;getXMLState(s); // like steps (2, 4, 6, and 8) using the new reference.</pre>
<p>and the result is:</p>
<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
  &lt;CustomerID&gt;1475&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
  &lt;CustomerName&gt;Michelangelo&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;</pre>
<li>Deleting Sub objects. All objects, no matter how they were created, are 
destroyed the same. The list contains both Factory created objects and Objects 
created the traditional way. Once again this shows how seamlessly the ORB fits 
together with the XMLFoundations&#39;s Object Factory. This the CORBA 
Implementation/Interface and <code>XMLObject</code> are all one in the same. 
This cleans up the whole mess.</li>
<pre lang="C++">CustObject1-&gt;delSubObjects();</pre>
<p>on the server:</p>
<pre lang="C++">void ExCORBAImpl::delSubObjects() IT_THROW_DECL((CORBA::SystemException))
{
   GListIterator it(&amp;m_lstCMyImplObjs);
   while(it())
   {
         XMLObject *pO = (XMLObject *)it++;
         pO-&gt;DecRef();
   }
   m_lstCMyImplObjs.RemoveAll();
}</pre>
<li>To see that step 11 worked, view the XML state like we did in 2,4,6,8, &amp; 10. 
Now all the contained objects are gone, and &quot;SuperUser&quot; is alone.</li>
<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyCORBAImpl&gt;
   &lt;CustomerID&gt;777&lt;/CustomerID&gt;
   &lt;CustomerName&gt;SuperUser&lt;/CustomerName&gt;
&lt;/MyCORBAImpl&gt;</pre>
</ol>
<h2><a name="COM_Objects">COM Objects</a></h2>
<p>Create a basic ATL COM project with Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Visual Studio will write your IDL, and implementation header files. The 
following code sample is the standard implementation header file with the 
addition of deriving from public XMLObject, the DECLARE_FACTORY macro, and 
MapXMLTagsToMembers.</p>
// IAddress Interface
<pre lang="C++">class ATL_NO_VTABLE CAddress :
    public CComObjectRootEx&lt;ComSingleThreadModel&gt;,
    public CComCoClass&lt;CAddress, &amp;CLSID_Address&gt;,
    public IDispatchImpl&lt;IAddress&gt;, &amp;IID_IAddress, &amp;LIBID_ATLExample2012Lib, /*wMajor =*/ 1, 0&gt;,
    public XMLObject
{
    void MapXMLTagsToMembers(){};
public:
    DECLARE_FACTORY(CAddress, Address)



In your implementation file you&#39;ll need to add the macro at a global scope and implement 
MapXMLTagsToMembers() to define the Object to XML mappings.  This example maps an integer, 
a string, and a list of COM objects.

&lt;pre lang=&quot;C++&quot;&gt;void CMyATLObj::MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
   MapObjectID(&quot;CustomerID&quot;,1);
   MapMember(&amp;m_nInteger, &quot;CustomerID&quot;);
   MapMember(&amp;m_strString, &quot;CustomerName&quot;, &amp;gGenericStrHandler);
   MapMember(&amp;m_lstCMyATLObj, CMyATLObj::GetStaticTag(),&amp;gGListHandler,0);
}</pre>

The ExATLCOM sample application builds under VC6 and the ATLExample2012 builds 
under newer versions of Visual Studio. They both implement COM in a way that 
makes it NATIVE. You will see the additional methods that have been added to the 
COM Object. Most notably put_XMLState() that has the ability to assign members 
variables and create COM objects when supplied well-formed XML as input.

<pre lang="C++">STDMETHODIMP CMyATLObj::put_XMLState(BSTR newVal)
{
     _bstr_t b(newVal);
     FromXML((const char *)b);
     return S_OK;
}</pre>
<h2><a name="Object_Caching_and_Instance_Management_">Object Caching and 
Instance Management</a></h2>

XMLFoundation has been serving up the XML related needs of the application layer 
for nearly a decade. It has been used to build a wide variety of application 
types. A common recurring need in the application layer has to do with &quot;data 
updates&quot;. Any application that receives XML updates might consider the 
performance advantages and reduction in development labor by using the 
XMLFoundation to solve the problem for them. For example, suppose you had some 
large dump of XML data. In your application layer you need to quickly access 
individual pieces of that information. In just a few lines of code, the XML can 
be mapped to a keyed data structure for fast indexed reads by your application. 
If the initial XML dataset was 100+million records - you will want to provide 
updates to your indexed information rather than rebuilding the entire index. You 
could write the code to search for the data to update, or allow the 
XMLFoundation to manage it for you. Another common example in distributed 
systems: Data is often cached at a middle tier or in the application itself. 
Efficiently designed systems only update an &quot;Address&quot; rather than a whole 
&quot;Customer&quot; and all his &quot;Orders&quot; when an &quot;Address&quot; changes. XMLFoundation can 
greatly simplify this task. At the core of caching is something XMLFoundation 
calls the OID, or Object ID. It is a unique key to the object, and any object 
that participates in XMLFoundation caching must have one. The definition of the 
OID can come from 2 places. It can be defined in the XML data, or it can be 
defined by the object that mapped the data. This is how a &quot;&#39;MyOrderLineItem&quot; 
object might define the OID. It uses a combination of the &quot;ProductID&quot; and 
&quot;UnitPrice&quot; so in this example a price change constitutes a different object. 
Normally an OID has a direct correlation to DBMS indexes in properly <a href="http://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataNormalization.html">
normalized data</a>. ObjectID&#39;s can be made to work well over poor data models 
too. This example code uses two XML Elements (&quot;ProductID&quot; and &quot;UnitPrice&quot;) to 
build the unique object ID. MapObjectID() also allows you to use Attributes to 
define the OID.

<pre lang="C++">void MyOrderLineItem::MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
     MapObjectID(&quot;ProductID&quot;,1,&quot;UnitPrice&quot;,1);
}</pre>

Alternatively the OID can be directly defined by the data itself with a special 
attribute named &quot;OID&quot; - so that NO CODE needs to be written.

<pre lang="xml">&lt;MyOrderLineItem oid=&#39;777&#39;&gt;
     &lt;ProductID&gt;123&lt;/ProductID&gt;
     &lt;UnitPrice&gt;7.77&lt;/UnitPrice&gt;
&lt;/MyOrderLineItem&gt;</pre>

The sample application &quot;ObjectCache&quot; provides over 30 test cases that detail the 
usage of object caching.

<h2><a name="Parsed_and_Unparsed_Object_Data">Parsed and Unparsed Object Data</a></h2>

For the most part - objects contain members. Members are mapped to attributes 
and elements in the XML. For the most part - that is how most XML documents are 
arranged but as you will see here there are yet still two other forms of markup 
for getting untagged data into the object. As a prerequisite to reading the 
following paragraph you must know a little bit about what the XML specification 
refers to as CDATA, so go plug that into your favorite search engine if you are 
not familiar with unparsed data then when you pop your stack of things to do you 
will find yourself ready to continue reading this:

<pre lang="xml">&lt;Thing Color=&#39;Red White and Blue&#39;&gt;
     &lt;![CDATA[&lt;data&gt;x&lt;/data&gt;]]&gt;-Object Data-=         
         &lt;String&gt;Capitol Capital G&lt;/String&gt;
         &lt;Number&gt;777&lt;/Number&gt;
         &lt;Wrapper&gt;
              &lt;StringList&gt;one&lt;/StringList&gt;
                    &lt;StringList&gt;two&lt;/StringList&gt;
         &lt;/Wrapper&gt;=-More Object Data- 
&lt;/Thing&gt;</pre>

The class declaration below has Maps for all of the elements and attributes in 
the XML above. It makes no provisions for Object Data - Parsed or Unparsed.

<pre lang="C++">class MyCustomObject : public XMLObject
{
public:

     GString m_strString; // A String Member
     GString m_strColor; // An attribute , not an element
     int m_nInteger; // An Integer Member
     GStringList m_strList; // A String List


virtual void MapXMLTagsToMembers()
{
     MapMember( &amp;m_strList, &quot;StringList&quot;, &quot;Wrapper&quot;);
     MapMember( &amp;m_nInteger, &quot;Number&quot;);
     MapMember( &amp;m_strString, &quot;String&quot;);
     MapAttribute(&amp;m_strColor, &quot;Color&quot;);
}

DECLARE_FACTORY(MyCustomObject, Thing)

    MyCustomObject O;

    // This unparsed data from the XML is handed directly to the application layer.
    int nOffsetFromStartofXML = pG-&gt;Buf() - pzXML; // nOffsetFromStartofXML is 43


    pG = O.GetObjectDataStorage();
    // you can see by this offset that we are in a different memory region now 
    // (because the fragmented Object data is now contigous)

    // Notice how the Object Data is rearranged in the output to a lexically equal notation.
    // Also notice that no whitespace (carriage returns or tabs) can be used to beautify ugly Object Data

does not need 5Loaves. 5Loaves is implemented in a single file called 
ServerCore.cpp. It is a unique piece of code and it is very simple to use. There 
is no header file for ServerCore.cpp and it causes no DLL&#39;s to be loaded by your 
application. It is a portable, properly threaded, and well written server core 
that can be applied to countless custom server implementations. It is a Proxy. 
It is an HTTP Server. It is a &#39;connection joiner&#39;. ServerCore.cpp is currently 
used to accept TCP connections for an advanced networking 
<a href="http://cid-d7ec275e76d295cf.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Software/Xfer%20Eval.zip">
product called Xfer</a>. (note: Xfer is not open source). The ServerCore has a 
good portable threading model with some unique features that allow you to limit 
such things as, number of connections per IP/Subnet and Connections per second. 
The 5Loaves HTTP Server works faster than IIS or Apache in some cases. It has 
been designed to be fast and includes unique features such as &#39;content caching&#39; 
to serve up prebuilt HTTP headers and data from memory rather than from disk. 
The Core of 5Loaves is a ground up POSIX threaded TCP server. This server 
template can be applied to build many types of applications that service TCP 
connections. The sample programs are server applications that use the 5Loaves 
ServerCore. One example is the 5Loaves shell console. It is a command line 
interpreter like the DOS prompt or a Unix shell written from scratch. It is a 
useful application starting point if you ever need a simple shell that has been 
tested in Linux, Solaris, AIX, HPUX, and Windows. There is also a Windows 
Service application. It contains the proper implementation for integrating 
5Loaves with the Windows Service Control Manager. There is also an example 
program with all the source to an ActiveX implementation of 5Loaves so you can 
see that this server core can be embed just about anywhere in any development 
language. The following code sample shows you how to start the HTTP service from 
inside your own process. You can&#39;t do that with IIS or Apache. The HTTP server 
does support binary plugins like ISAPI, and there is an example program that 
creates plugins. It&#39;s an advanced HTTP server.

Building a Custom HTTP Web Service</a></h2>
Approach #1 - &quot;Low Level Static Code&quot; Adding on to the rather trivial amount of 
code shown above for integrating ServerCore, you may want to develop a custom 
&quot;dynamic content&quot; server based on this HTTP server implementation that can be 
easily integrated into YOUR process (unlike IIS or Apache). There are several 
ways to go about accomplishing this task and depending on your situation one way 
may be more appropriate than another. One way of implementing a custom 
ServerCore extension can be accomplished via &quot;Low Level Static Code&quot;. The 
advantage to this form of integration is that no DLL&#39;s are loaded. Another 
possible advantage is that no form of integration could possibly be faster. 
Using this approach ServerCore will manage nothing except for multi-threading 
the connections for you and the initial TCP network read. This can be done by 
adding this one line of code:
<pre lang="C++">#define SERVERCORE_CUSTOM_HTTP</pre>
prior to adding this line of code:
<pre lang="C++"> #include &quot;../Core/ServerCore.cpp&quot;</pre>
You will also have to create a file called ServerCoreCustomHTTP.cpp, a sample 
implementation has been provided in the Server/Core folder. To see it work in 
the &quot;5Loaves&quot; example project add the #define SERVERCORE_CUSTOM_HTTP into the 
file Servers/5loaves/Console.cpp then create a text file called 5Loaves.txt that 
you can place in the same folder as the binary or at &quot;C:\\&quot; with this contents.
<pre lang="text">[System]
Pool=20
ProxyPool=0


[HTTP]
Enable=yes</pre>
This sets the thread pool to 20 setting the limit of your server to 20 
concurrent client connections and supports no proxy connections, you may set the 
thread pool at any value that you have enough hardware resources to support. 
Making this example work in the Windows Service is equally as simple by adding 
#define SERVERCORE_CUSTOM_HTTP into 
Servers/WebServerService/WebServerService.cpp (directly above the inclusion of 
<em>ServerCore.cpp</em>) This will extend the service application to run a 
custom &#39;low level - static code&#39; extension that is implemented in <em>
ServerCoreCustomHTTP.cpp</em> 
exactly like the console application. I have two products that both use this 
&quot;Low Level Static Code&quot; approach to extending 
<em>ServerCore.cpp</em>. It is my preferred approach when building an 
&quot;application&quot; based on <em>ServerCore.cpp</em> because the integration is 
&quot;tight&quot; beyond the definition of &quot;tight&quot;. You should search <em>ServerCore.cpp</em> 
for SERVERCORE_CUSTOM_HTTP to see for yourself that this is not function call - 
but a true inline implementation into the very first call stack frame of the 
servicing thread. Since the code is being added directly into the lowest level 
possible there is no function call dispatch, it executes the extension without 
even adding a new frame on the call stack (you can&#39;t do that with IIS or Apache 
- much less in YOUR process space) - this makes the extension code look strange 
because there will be no open scope { or close of scope } - and you will exit 
with a GOTO rather than a return. For example consider this complete example 
found in <em>Servers/Core/ServerCoreCustomHTTP.cpp</em>:
<pre lang="C++">//
// Server Core Extension Example for when SERVERCORE_CUSTOM_HTTP is defined in ServerCore.cpp
//

// There are many variables available to the current scope.  A few of exceptional interest are:
// [td-&gt;sockfd] the socket handle
// [sockBuffer] the raw network data directly in the TCP kernel buffer
// [nContentLen] the Content-Length from the HTTP header
// [nBytes] bytes in [sockBuffer] (note there may be more in transit if Content-Length &gt; nBytes )
if (memcmp(sockBuffer,&quot;GET&quot;,3) == 0)
{
   
     GString strRequest;
     // extract the file name starting at the 4th byte up to the first space
     // Proper HTTP will look like this:GET /Index.html HTTP/1.1
     strRequest.SetFromUpTo(&amp;sockBuffer[4],&quot; &quot;);

     // now you have the request in the variable [strRequest]

     // you need to generate a response for yourself based on the request.
     // This is a good place to dispatch your call to your own functions
     // You might return HTML, or XML
     GString strResponse(&quot;Server Response: Hello World&quot;);
   
     // since we did not build any custom HTTP headers we&#39;ll send the response back through HTTPSend()
     // This will build the HTTP headers for us setting the Content-Length - required for valid HTTP.
     HTTPSend(td-&gt;sockfd, strResponse, strResponse.Length());

     // alternatively we could setup the HTTP header ourselves and call nonblocksend()
     // int nonblocksend(int fd,const char *pData,int nDataLen)

     // lastly - manage this connection and thread.
     // this will read the next HTTP command from this connection - on this thread
     goto KEEP_ALIVE;

     // alternatively we could close this connection and return this thread to the pool
     // nCloseCode = 7000;
     // goto SOCKET_ERR_ABORT;

}
else if (memcmp(sockBuffer,&quot;POST /&quot;,6) == 0)
{
     // likewise the same ideals apply for a POST handler
}</pre>
Now - to see this example work... Run 5Loaves.exe with the 5Loaves.txt in the 
same directory Put this URL into your browser: http://127.0.0.1/ Your browser 
will display &quot;Server Response: Hello World&quot; Approach #2 - &quot;Binary Plugin&quot; This 
next approach to extending an HTTP service is more typical. Both IIS and Apache 
support both CGI and ISAPI to support user developed web server extensions via 
&quot;Binary Plugin&#39;s&quot;. This approach allows you to rebuild the extension without 
rebuilding the HTTP server. You will create a DLL (under Windows) or an SO 
(under Unix) that works a lot like ISAPI. The HTTP service will load and execute 
your extension giving you access to everything necessary to build any kind of 
custom extension. The ServerCore adds one additional layer of abstraction by 
invoking the &quot;Plugin&quot; through the &quot;Language Driver&quot; described in the next 
section.

<h2><a name="Plugins_and_Language_Drivers">Plugins and Language Drivers</a></h2>
The XMLFoundation supports &quot;Language Drivers&quot;. 5Loaves is among the applications 
that implements them. Language drivers allow user developed extensions to be 
invoked programmatically. Just about every programming language can have a 
language driver developed for it. Several complete Language Driver 
implementations come with the XMLFoundation source code. The programmer&#39;s code 
is &quot;the plugin&quot; that is executed by the &quot;Language Driver&quot;. The majority of 
people who use this technology will probably be developing &quot;plugins&quot;, but you 
also may develop an application that allows users to develop their own plugins. 
All of the source code for everything I speak of is included in the 
XMLFoundation, see [IntegrationBase.h/cpp][IntegrationLanguages.h/cpp], using <em>
DynamicLibrary.h</em> to load the DLL/SO&#39;s on many platforms. I have used the 
Language Driver functionality in several applications. For example, I have an 
XSLT that allows user extensions in addition to the built-in XSL keywords. This 
allows my application to pass a string value into a user defined method in a 
plugin that might need to do a database lookup to translate a code - a task that 
is too complex for any XSL keyword. Loading the &quot;Language Driver&quot; and executing 
a plugin does not require much code. This is the code to pack 4 arguments and 
invoke a plugin called &quot;Test1&quot; inside &quot;PluginExample.dll&quot; through the CStdCall 
Language Driver:
<pre lang="C++">// pack 4 arguments -- same code to call (C++/Java/COM/Perl/Python) plugins
 // 1. a 4 bytes string (&quot;aaa&quot; + null)
 // 2. a 4 byte string  (&quot;bbb&quot; + null)
 // 3. a 4 byte unsigned long (the .... starts at the 8th byte and will be overwritten)
 // 4. a 5 byte string  (&quot;fast&quot; + null)
 char pzArgBuff[256];
 sprintf(pzArgBuff,&quot;aaa%cbbb%c....fast%c&quot;,0,0,0);  // the .... is a 4 byte placeholder
 unsigned long *pL = (unsigned long *)&amp;pzArgBuff[8]; // get an int pointer to the 8th byte
 *pL = 777;     // overwrite the (....) with the packed binary value for 777
 char pzArgSizes[16];
 strcpy(pzArgSizes,&quot;4|4|4|5&quot;);

 // Invoke the plugin....
 InterfaceInstance *pII = GetInterfaceInstance(&quot;CStdCall&quot;);
 // InvokeEx may modify the pzArgBuff, but generally results should be in pzResults
 int nOutResultSize;
 const char *pzResults = pII-&gt;InvokeEx( &quot;PluginExample.dll&quot;, &quot;PluginExample&quot;, &quot;Test1&quot;,
                                           pzArgBuff,pzArgSizes,&amp;nOutResultSize, &quot;anonymous&quot;,
                                           &quot;password&quot; );</pre>
The code shown above would be in the hosting application, or the application 
that supports custom extensions. It will then execute the plugin that is even 
easier to develop (code shown below):
<pre lang="C++">ExposedMethods() should define the arguments like this:
Test1&amp;&amp;One&amp;&amp;char *&amp;&amp;Two&amp;&amp;char  *&amp;&amp;Three&amp;&amp;Packed Unsigned Long&amp;&amp;Four&amp;&amp;char *
extern &quot;C&quot; __declspec(dllexport) void Test1(void *pHandle, DriverExec Exec,
                                                const char *One,     // string &quot;aaa&quot;
                                              const char *Two,     // string &quot;bbb&quot;
                                              const char *Three,   // unsigned long
                                              const char *Four)    // string &quot;fast&quot;

{
     PlugInController PIC(pHandle, Exec);

     // dereference Three and increment it by one, this changes
     // the argument value in the callers memory space in the application -
     // (pzArgBuf above setting *pL to 778)
     // The direct memory reference is passed into the language driver -
     // then passed into this DLL/SO
     (*(unsigned long *)Three)++;

     // If you want to modify the argument Three locally use this code:
      unsigned long uThree = *(unsigned long *)Three);
      uThree++;
      PIC.AppendResults(&quot;Argument 3 is Native Packed Binary in a Plugin&quot;);
}</pre>
One sample application titled &quot;PluginExample&quot; is devoted to C++ plugins. It 
shows how to write several types of POST handler plugins for the HTTP server. 
You will find the utility class CMultiPartForm handy if you need to write a 
handler for a Multipart HTTP POST, other plugin utilities like PlugInController 
found in <em>PluginBuilder.h</em> make the job of building a plugin as easy as 
possible.

<em>ServerCore.cpp</em> has the implementation using (InterfaceInstance 
*)pII-&gt;InvokeEx() described above already complete so that you may extend the 
HTTP service via your own DLL(or COM object or Perl/Python script). This is how 
to build a custom dynamic web page from an HTTP server plugin:
<ol>
<li>Compile the CStdCall Language Driver   
 
 

</li><li>Compile the PluginExample   
 
 
</li><li> Setup the 5Loaves.txt Configuration File like this (but set the 
[TXML]Drivers= and [CStdCall]Path= to where steps 1 and 2 compiled to):

The HTTP service will loop through the ServerPluginN entries and dispatch the 
plugin calls for you. You must configure the ServerPluginN entries in numerical 
order and the HTTP service will load each entry upto the first numerical break. 
You may also manage the dispatch partially yourself by using a wildcard * in the 
first argument - for example.
<pre>ServerPlugin1=/PluginPage*|CStdCall|MyDLL.dll|MyDLL|DoIt</pre>

project directory if you run 5Loaves.exe under a debugger or put 5Loaves.txt in

either way when it starts 5Loaves will display this message:</li>
 

 
<pre lang="text">5Loaves&gt;Windows Console using [5Loaves.txt]

is simply a static bound html page - put this URL into your browser: 
http://127.0.0.1/Page1</li>
 

The browser will show a simple web page with 3 edit fields and a &quot;Submit&quot; 
button. If you see that page - the plugin executed properly through an HTTP GET 
which loaded an HTML page that will POST back the 3 arguments into another 
handler that exists in that same plugin. The information POST&#39;ed by the HTML 
form calls a method with with 3 arguments. So you supply the values 1, 2, and 3 
to the three edit fields and press submit your browser will display this:
<pre lang="text">5Loaves HTTP Server Invoked me with [1] and [2] and [3]!</pre><li>
Now try this URL: <em>http://127.0.0.1/test2WWWPage&amp;root&amp;777&amp;superuser</em> and 
this will be the result:</li>

<h2><a name="FiveLoaves_Tunneling_and_Messaging">FiveLoaves Tunneling and 
Messaging</a></h2>
5Loaves provides tunneling with encryption and compression as a base service. It 
can be used to secure internet connections much like SSH. It works by running 
some form of server with the 5Loaves engine on two machines. The data passed 
between those machines can be compressed or encrypted or simply logged. Starting 
the server is done exactly the same no matter if you are running the HTTP 
service or the Tunneling service - only the configuration startup string 
changes. The following configuration example will open a listener on port 1972, 
anything it receives will be encrypted and compressed and sent to 
[www.ExampleServer.com] on port 2009. The server will decrypt and decompress the 
data from port 2009 and forward it to port 1972, so the data on port 1972 at the 
server will be as if the client had directly sent it. To open a tunnel entry 
point on the client side use this:
<pre lang="text">[Tunnel1]
Enable=yes
LocalPort=1972
RemotePort=2009
RemoteMachine=www.ExampleServer.com
Timeout=30
CompressEnabled=yes
CipherPass=Tiger
RawPacketProxy=no</pre>
To exit the tunnel on the server:
<pre lang="text">[Proxy1]
Enable=yes
LocalPort=2009
RemotePort=1972
RemoteMachine=127.0.0.1  (we could also use an internal resource like
192.168.*)
Timeout=60
RawPacketProxy=no
CompressEnabled=yes
CipherPass=Tiger</pre>
Note: you can start any number of tunnels, simply increment the section 
[Tunnel2] and [Proxy2]. ServerCore will stop loading tunnels at the first break 
of numeric order of the [sectionN]. This type of usage may be of interest 
especially to web developers or people who are just curious. Sometimes it&#39;s 
interesting to see the data between the HTTP server and the browser. Redirects 
and HTML frames and Javascript can make that difficult. This section sets up a 
clear text proxy just for the purpose of seeing the transmission log between the 
browser and the web-server. Once this is running, connect with a web browser to 
127.0.0.1 and you in fact be connecting to the endpoint configured under the 
RemoteMachine= entry.
<pre>[Tunnel2]
Enable=yes
LocalPort=80
RemotePort=80
RemoteMachine=www.SampleWebSite.com
Timeout=65000
RawPacketProxy=yes
LogPath=c:\HTMLSpy
LogBinary=no
LogEnabled=yes</pre>
In the folder HTMLSpy you will see a log file of the communication between the 
browser and the web server. I used Firefox as a browser, and the 5Loaves HTTP 
server for this example. I loaded the page twice in the browser so that you can 
see the caching mechanism working between the browser and the web server in this 
log file: The header is defined like this: &quot;tx-&gt;s&quot; means &quot;transmit to server&quot; so 
that is information that came from the browser, it is followed by the time, then 
the total bytes transmitted, 470 in this case. The reply is &quot;tx-&gt;c&quot; or &quot;transmit 
to client&quot;, you can see that the HTTP server responded with 181 bytes that 
instructed the browser to use the version it has cached. You can also see that 
the &quot;Server:&quot; name was set to &quot;MyWebServer&quot;, that is a variable in the 5Loaves 
HTTP server unlike the static names IIS and Apache use.

5loaves has a unique network connectivity utility built in. It allows machines 
behind a firewall that cannot &quot;listen&quot; for connections outside the network to 
accept connections from anywhere without any firewall configuration changes. 
There is a complete example called &quot;FilePoster&quot; that puts a file on a machine 
behind a firewall. This is a bare bones &#39;proof of concept&#39; implementation that 
gives you a working model to customize for your own purposes. It requires three 
machines to see it work as designed.

<strong>Machine 1 </strong>- (the switchboard) should be located on the 
internet. You must run the HTTP service along with the &quot;Switchboard Service&quot;, 
you can see that this example runs it on port 81 just incase you have IIS or 
Apache already on port 80.
<pre lang="text">[SwitchBoardServer]
Enable=yes
Name=/PublicPath/

[HTTP]
Enable=yes
Port=81
ContentCache=0
UseKeepAlives=1
HTTPHeaderServerName=5Loaves
KeepAliveTimeOut=20
ShowIPAddressPageName=ShowIP
Home=d:\home

[Trace]
HTTPHeaderTrace=0
ThreadTrace=0
ConnectTrace=1</pre>
<strong>Machine 2 </strong>- (the server) this is the machine behind the 
firewall that you want to open up a connection path to. It will poll the 
switchboard server looking for connections. It should run 5oaves with the 
configuration below. This will accept remote data, and write it to disk in a 
file at &quot;<em>c:\5LMessages\UBTsAccountForYou</em>&quot;. You could change the 
application logic that writes the file - you can do anything with the data that 
may contain commands, database queries, or custom logic.
<pre lang="text">[Messaging]
Enable=yes
AcceptFrom=UBTsAccountForYou
DefaultSwitchBoardServer=10.20.30.40
DefaultSwitchBoardPort=81
UseBrowserProxy=no


[MsgFrom-UBTsAccountForYou]
Enable=yes
CheckAtSwitchBoard=yes
Name=/PublicPath/UBTsAccountForYou
DiskLocation=c:\5LMessages\UBTsAccountForYou
LetSenderPlaceFile=No
PollIntervalSeconds=20</pre>
<strong>Machine 3</strong>- (the client) runs the FilePoster sample application. 
Machine 3 can reach &quot;the switchboard (machine 1)&quot; but not &quot;the server (machine 
2)&quot;. We will send the data to Machine 2 and get a response back from that 
machine. In this case we are simply writing the data we send to a file, but the 
data could just as easily have been an SQL statement and the return data could 
be the result set rather than just a confirmation that the file was written. How 
it works: The &quot;server&quot; polls into the &quot;switchboard&quot; with an HTTP GET. The 
&quot;client&quot; pushes a multipart HTTP POST to the &quot;switchboard&quot;. The switchboard 
joins the connections and proxies the data. An HTTP GET needs an HTTP &quot;200 OK&quot; 
so the &quot;switchboard&quot; server rips off the POST headers from the data sent up by 
the &quot;client&quot; and replaces them with an HTTP 200 followed by the POST data that 
gets proxy-ed straight through. Once this initial message proxy is complete, the 
client connection that POSTed it waits in the switchboard, for the server to 
POST back a response. Then the Switchboard goes through the same process of 
ripping off the POST HTTP header and replacing it with a 200 OK before sending 
the response back to the client. Lastly, the switchboard server replies with an 
empty HTTP 200 to the servers response POST to complete the normal HTTP 
request/response design for both the client and the server. This allows it to 
pass through HTTP proxy servers and direct support for them is included. 
Technically this is a loophole through most networks that only allow HTTP, 
because as you see we invented a new protocol that looks like HTTP, but in fact 
it is not.

<h2><a name="Translating_XML">Translating XML</a></h2>

Translating values before the assignment of member variables from XML is a 
common need in the application layer. Also, the reverse that, translating the 
value stored in the member variable to the value that will appear in the XML. 
Without writing ANY code, we can Map() the translation logic with fine tuned 
control. This is done using the last 3 arguments of MapMember(). Here is the 
comment taken from <em>XMLObject.h</em> explaining those last three arguments:  

<pre lang="cs">//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Using Translation Maps (new in November 2013)
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////-///////////////
// pzTranslationMapIn translates values - for example this is how you might use it on a String:
// if pzTranslationMapIn = &quot;red*=Red,Mary Jane=Green,Grass=Green,XML_EMPTY_VALUE=Blue,XML_DEFAULT=Unknown
// ---------------------------------------------------------
// if &lt;pTag&gt; in the source xml starts with red - like &quot;redness&quot; or &quot;reddish&quot; it assigns member pValue = &quot;Red&quot;
// if &lt;pTag&gt; in the source xml is &quot;Mary Jane&quot; or &quot;Grass&quot; - it assigns member pValue = &quot;Green&quot;
// if &lt;pTag&gt;&lt;/pTag&gt; is empty in source xml - it assigns member pValue = &quot;Blue&quot;
// &lt;Tag&gt;&lt;/Tag&gt; will assign a mapped m_member = &quot;&quot;,
// unless XML_EMPTY_VALUE in pzTranslationMapIn overrides default behavior
// which will set m_strString2 == &quot;Blue&quot; due to XML_EMPTY_VALUE=Blue in pzTranslationMapIn.
//
// pzTranslationMapOut translates values in the XML
// to differ from what the member variable stores - for example:
// if pzTranslationMapOut = &quot;1=One,2=Two,777=Root,any*=anyTHING&quot;
// if pValue = &quot;1&quot; it will be seen as &quot;One&quot; in the XML.
// if pValue = &quot;2&quot; it will be seen as &quot;Two&quot; in the XML.
// if pValue = &quot;777&quot; it will be seen as &quot;Root&quot; in the XML.
// if pValue starts with &quot;any&quot; (like &quot;anyone&quot; or &quot;Anytime&quot;
// (all wildward searches are case insensitive)) it comes out as &quot;anyTHING&quot; in the XML.
//
// if XML_DEFAULT is specified and there is no known translation for the value, this value will be used.
// if XML_DEFAULT is not specified and there is no known
// translation for the value, the untranslated value will be used
// if XML_DEFAULT= is followed by a comma or null like
// this: &quot;A=1,B=2,XML_DEFAULT=,C=3&quot; or like this &quot;A=1,B=2,C=3,XML_DEFAULT=&quot;
// then the value with no known translation will NOT be used, and the value will be &quot;&quot; aka empty.
//
//
// .....and this is how you might use it on an Integer:
// pzTranslationMapIn = &quot;1=10,2=20,3=777,one=10,two=20,three=777,XML_EMPTY_VALUE=-777,XML_DEFAULT=0&quot;
// pzTranslationMapOut = &quot;10=ten,20=twenty,777=infinity,XML_DEFAULT=0&quot;
//
// 
// and the last argument, nTranslationFlags can be any combinations of these values:
// XLATE_CASE_INSENSITIVE_IN // When assigning variables from XML
// XLATE_CASE_INSENSITIVE_OUT // When writing XML translations
// XLATE_NO_IN_WILDCARDS // you never NEED to set this, as it is calculated and cached.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
</pre>

That may sound complex - but it&#39;s very easy to use. See the example program <em>
TranslatingXML.cpp</em> where this (simple) code was taken from. The yellow 
string affects how member variables are assigned a value. The green string 
affects how the XML is created. Each member variable has it&#39;s own translation 
rules. Notice where the other colors are referenced in the places where they are 
used.

}</pre><h2><a name="XMLFoundation_for_Java_">XMLFoundation for Java</a></h2>
XMLFoundation supports Java too, it supports all Java data types like (string, 
byte, bool, double, long, short) as well as Java data structures such as (Vector 
Stack ArrayList LinkedList TreeSet HashSet). The XMLFoundation for Java is 
binary. If you want to build it yourself, you can because the source code to the 
entire JavaXMLFoundation is public and included in this release. There is no 
need to build it, but it&#39;s nice to be able to. I can hear some uneducated Java 
programmer already saying &quot;I only want a &#39;Pure&#39; Java solution&quot;. This is Pure. 
It&#39;s as pure as the JVM, because if you look close you&#39;ll see that it is 
actually an enhancement to the JVM. The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is written in 
C and C++. Your Java code runs anywhere the JVM can compile, and the 
XMLFoundation works the same way. The good news is that Java programmers don&#39;t 
have to deal with C++ just because their JVM is written in C++. The same is true 
of the XMLFoundation for Java. The XMLFoundation uses JNI (Java Native 
Interface). It parses the XML in the native binary (that was created by a C++ 
compiler just like the JVM) and instantiates &#39;pure&#39; Java Objects through JNI, 
then it assigns all the member variables just like the C++ XMLFoundation does. 
Can you think of a faster way to get the job done? This is some sample code that 
uses the JavaXMLFoundation. A much more detailed example is included in the 
source code:

// members and/or attributes of this object that uniquely identify
// it among all instances of it&#39;s own type. &quot;ObjectId&quot;&#39;s are
// optional but allow you to perform complex &quot;object updates&quot;
// easily through XML. In main() below, this functionality is
// used when getXML2() is applied. ObjectId&#39;s are like a database
// primary key in that they are generally not modified.

of XMLFoundation</a></h2>
The XMLFoundation was designed and developed mostly by <a href="http://cid-d7ec275e76d295cf.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/Business/Resume%20of%20Brian%20Aberle.doc">
myself</a>, with lots of help from me and I (<a href="http://about.me/brian.aberle">http://about.me/brian.aberle</a>) 
however I had help from co-designers on the NCIS (National Clinical Information 
System) Project, and mostly only 1 other co-developer. Special thanks to the 
SAIC management who believed in me and gave me the opportunity to develop the 
mother product. Thanks to everyone who stood beside me during the long and 
expensive labor of putting this work together. &quot;I told you so&quot; to everyone else. 
In the end technology prevails over politics and ignorance. The XMLFoundation 
contains several independent algorithms that were developed by other authors - 
and their supporting communities - their source code contains more information 
about them. Historically it has been the solo engineers that set the direction 
for the masses. Bjarne Stroustrup incremented the work of Brian Kernighan and 
Dennis Ritchie. There are countless contributors from the purest perspective of 
technology advancement and they could not possibly all be named here.
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, this started a long time ago and it&#39;s not going away anytime 
soon. It&#39;s a masterpiece conspiracy to end times of high crimes.
